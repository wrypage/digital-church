41,4e492843c465beef,1308,7254,en,whisper_local,base,v1.0,2026-02-18 04:05:38,shortest,"Welcome to the Curious Faith Podcast. Faith is the absence of questions. It is learning where to take them. In each episode we tackle one honest question and seek a biblical, thoughtful answer. My name is Ryan Johnson and my curious companion for today's episode is Mr. Jonathan Light. Jonathan how you doing? I'm doing well. How are you doing? I'm doing good. I'm doing good. Thank you for joining me in this inaugural episode of the Curious Faith Podcast and I'm excited to venture out. And so Jonathan, let's just get at it. What is today's question? All right. So today's question for the inaugural episode is why start a podcast built entirely around questions? What a great question, Jonathan. Well, you've heard me say it often. If you're a member of a God-pay Baptist church here in Scottsboro, Alabama, I love questions. I love questions wherever I am. And because we all have questions and a lot of times we have questions about things that are spiritual in nature, but we are either afraid to ask them. We don't know who to ask. We don't want to ask where people know that we're thinking that because we're afraid of people thinking that we're doubting. And so I really think a core part of my ministry is really to help people understand that questions aren't a threat to faith, that they're invitations to deeper faith. If you're not asking questions, if you're not curious about what you're reading in scripture, if you're not curious about the Christian life, then you're probably not operating off of an active faith. And so this podcast really just exists to take one honest question for episode and dig deeper and answer it biblically and clearly. I'm not trying to win arguments. We're not trying to gain favor with anybody. We're just trying to get clarity and confidence as we walk on this journey and discipleship. And so that's the goal of podcast. It's just to help you think clearly and believe confidently and follow Jesus faithfully. Awesome. Awesome. So the curious companion, what exactly is that role? Well, it is. That's your role, Jonathan. At least in today's episode and in the future, we may have a couple of curious companions on here. But just to make it clear the nature of the podcast, the curious companion is not a debate opponent. We're not trying to trap skeptics, obviously. It's not scripted fluff. You are the voice of curiosity, right? So whereas I'm curious to hear the questions and to answer the questions, your response is follow-up. You're essentially the voice of the listener of the podcast and you're trying to anticipate the person who asks, you know, but what about this as I answer and then want you to press me, you know, when something needs clarification. So the if you're listening to this podcast, the curious companion represents you. It's the person who's listening and thinking, okay, but I don't get this part. So they're going to do follow-up questions in your honor. But this format is really about like creating clarity. You've heard me say that a couple of times now. And it's one question for episode because we're really not trying to rush through, you know, bullet point answers. We're striving for depth over breadth. If you all, if you do know me, you know that I am typically not concise. And so this podcast is trying to force me into a place to be concise. And so these episodes are going to be about 12 to 20 minutes per episode. And I hope by doing that, we will not only help you see this podcast as accessible, but as something that you can just build into your day and to your routine as podcasts are prone to do. Absolutely. And past around, where are these questions coming from? Well, they are coming from past events that I've done. They are coming from conversations that I've had with people. I'm not sharing details about the people who are asking questions, but it's really just about the question itself. If there's any relevant context, of course, we'll give that. But the goal is just to answer questions that have been asked to me. And the questions that we're going to start with are questions that have been asked during the live services at Agape. We have the QR code on the screen during every service so that people can ask those questions. And the hope is is that we'll start with the questions that people have asked most recently. And then we will get into some of the questions that I've encountered from the past. And so yeah, that's really where the questions are coming from. So the idea, folks, is that we want to kind of make a commitment to you that when you queue up this podcast that you can expect and answer from scripture, you know, you can you can know that we're going to be clear. We're going to be charitable about about where Christians disagree. We're sure multiple viewpoints. If that's what you need to know in terms of the question that's been asked, obviously, I love questions. That means I have to love hard questions, right? Which I got some incredible questions at the m"
76,fff27fa6b5ef676a,2857,14646,en,whisper_local,base,v1.0,2026-02-18 12:09:28,shortest,"Hello and welcome to the her salad ground pot cap. I'm Lisa Vanama, your host and I can't wait to dig into Gads Truth through today. Let's get grounded. Well listeners, I wanted to start today off with a little bit of a confession. It's always good to start a conversation with a confession, huh? Lean in a little closer. It's not that big of a deal. But I have a little bit behind in my podcasting. Typically, I am several weeks out, sometimes months out on topics and recordings and lately because of life and just getting adjusted to the new rhythm here at the podcast. It's been sometimes a week by week thing and the schedule is a little bit tight. But the benefit of that has been that as I have chosen topics, I really have been able to take a step back and look at our world or what we as a collective church are experiencing in this moment and really try to speak into and maybe minister a little bit to that specifically. And I do personally feel like the last several weeks have been a little heavy. I mean, let's be honest, last couple years have been a little heavy but I don't know if about you, but I feel like there's been a lot of noise in this world over the last several weeks. And it's exhausting. It's heavy as believers and lovers of the Lord. I feel like many of us take that very personally. We know that division and conflict and pain and hurting is not anything that the Lord wants for our world. He wants us to be at peace and he wants us to be united in him. And so it grieves him when he sees this world hurting and I think it grieves us when we see this world hurting because we have the Holy Spirit inside of us. And so I was thinking back to a few years ago when I was going through a similar season personally where things just felt really heavy. I was taking life pretty seriously and I was definitely weighed down by a lot of worry and overthinking and stress. So I decided that the remedy for this was to paint my front door blue. That sounds a little bit crazy, right? But it really might not be even a big deal to some of you. But remember a couple episodes ago when I told you that I'm more of a neutral girl. I choose safe things. And so choosing to paint my front door blue felt rebellious to me. It actually just felt fun. And now granted, in all things with my personality, you know, we don't change in overnight. And so of course I stressed over the color and shade of blue for three days. But I didn't let that deter me. I just felt like I needed to add some color to what felt like an endless season of gray skies and really deep reflection. I just needed some levity and somehow painting my front door blue felt like the next right thing. And honestly to this day, that front door makes me smile. It reminds me not to take life so seriously all the time and that sometimes simple joys can make all the difference. And so I wonder if maybe that's a word for you today. Maybe you are a little weighed down by the noise of the world or maybe you've been stuck in a season of your own life that feels especially draining. And you're seeking some sort of levity. You know, maybe you're feeling financial stress or a relationship stress or parenting demands or work deadlines. They can very easily add up and steal our sense of joy and wonder. They can like suck the life out of us, right? I mean, you just need to spend two minutes on social media and you feel that chaos just come right in conflict crisis. You name it. It's right there and it can be disheartening. And so what it looked like maybe for you to take a step away and to have maybe a blue door moment. Sometimes when life takes over and our circumstances can dictate our mood, I think we need to get intentional about joy. And yes, the joy of the Lord is our strength and his eternal presence is our hope. But I also think he gave us creative minds and capable hands that can be used to reveal his glory and even unlock the joy in our everyday lives. I'm not saying that those simple joys should replace him, but I do think they can be used to point us back to him. And so I wonder if maybe that's something you could consider today for yourself. Please don't misunderstand what I'm saying here. I'm not encouraging you to check out. What I'm encouraging you to do is to intentionally lean in to the goodness of God. Because when I look around and see the beauty that he created for his own glory, I believe that he also created it for our enjoyment. The chirping of birds, the colorful rainbow after the storm, the seasons and those rhythms we can always count on. I think of the stillness and even the vastness of the ocean, breathtaking sunsets, the taste of fresh strawberries that all points to the goodness of God. Goodness it, we get to enjoy and even joy more when we remember who it all comes from. It tells us in James that every good and perfect gift comes from God. So maybe instead of feeling like we have to bear the weight of our family on our shoulders or the weight of the worl"

All right, well, we already prayed, so we won't have to start with that again. So did you like doing the study? Was it a little bit harder than the one before? No, not too bad. Okay, how about the one before? God provides. A little bit more challenging, a little bit? No, okay, well good. Yes, well this is going to be a very emotional book. I was telling Nicole, I said this is going to be really harder to teach because there's so much talk about persecution and waiting through the persecution. And we don't like to talk about persecution because we don't like persecution. And unfortunately, we're kind of wamps when it comes to persecution because our idea persecution is somebody being mad at us at work, persecution back in Bible days where they were being eaten by lions. It's a little bit of a different situation. So, okay, all right, so coming off of what we started two weeks ago in the introduction, that the theme of this book we talked about, and there's many, many different themes in the book, but they all blend together. We walk through many of them as we did in the intro. So many believers during this time that Peter was talking about the persecution. So many of the believers, Jewish believers, were going back to Judaism. And they were doing this because they were waiting for Jesus to come back. They thought he was going to come back right away. And they were waiting and now it's been so many years and they're just going, you know, I don't know if we want to continue with this. There is so much persecution against Christians. And if they just went back to Judaism, the Romans were tolerating the Jews, but they hated the Christians. So in their mind it was like, well, we are Jews and we did accept Christ, but if we completely went back to Judaism, it'd be safer for us and safer for our children. They just wanted to go back to the way they were raised. And some of the Jews who had accepted Jesus as their Messiah were being persecuted and their faith was being tested daily. So Peter in this book is telling these scattered believers because they had been scattered everywhere. To find joy and strength and to find their security in Christ and to have that eternal future focus. Now I've shared with you before that when Pastor Jeff went to be with the Lord that the only thing that kept me sane during that time of missing him was that oxymoron sort of world I lived in where death is the worst thing you can go through. But it's also the best thing you can go through because, and you know what oxymoron means, it's the same event that brings different emotions. And I would think this is not how I wanted to live my life, but Jeff is living his best life. And I know for a fact he doesn't want to come back to this life, even though I wanted to come back. I would have loved that, but I don't know. And I've talked to so many widows and I go, do you really want your husbands to come back? And I go kind of and it's like, you know, they don't want to. They don't want to hear that. Because every widow wants to hear the year husband wants to come back and be with you. But really the truth is they don't. But these are scattered believers. And they were everywhere. And Peter is, you can see all the names of the places that he talks about in chapter 1, verse 1. And he's calling them to come back and to endure suffering for the sake of Christ. This call is also for us today. This is not just for back then. This is for us today because we have a different type of persecution. But the horrific things that went on in Rome during that time were unbelievable. You got to remember Rome ruled the entire world. Caesar was God. The Christians were told you must reverence Caesar as God and they just wouldn't do it. Persecution was increasing, so was their faith. Rome was a cruel taskmaster. If any of you seen any movies about Rome, Gladiator was one of them, where you can see what they would do. They did those not just to the Gladiators, but they did horrible things to the Christians. Again, Rome would tolerate Jews, but they would not tolerate Christians. Christians were hated and the hatred was growing every single year after Jesus died. There was so much hatred toward the Christians. The Romans believed that the Christians were dangerous. They made everything so much worse than it was. Sounds like Democrats today. They were called irrational. They were considered a cult. Christianity. Christians, like I said, they refused to worship the Roman gods. This was treason or sedition. They were in big trouble for not bending their knee to the Roman gods. Anything that happened in Rome, or they didn't know who started the fires or what went on, they blame the Christians. Plagues, disasters. Anything that happened in a day, they blame the Jews. They told the entire community that Christians were cannibals. They turned communion into something very ugly and something that was li"

Today on Sound Truth with Pastor Malcolm Wilde, Calvary Chapel, Mayor at Island. Where are your wise men? Let them tell you now and let them know what the Lord of hosts has purposed against Egypt. Here God is challenging the wisdom of the world and what they would be declared to do. Of course when it says Pharaoh's wise counsel, give foolish counsel, as you know, in Scripture often Egypt's typified as the world. Pharaoh often typifies kings of the world system and rulers of the world system. Everything in the Bible is perfectly accurate. Prophecy is about Jesus came true and it doesn't stop there. Today Pastor Malcolm will talk to you about what some of the events of the end times will look like. Some have possibly come to pass already and there's a lot of prophecy yet to be fulfilled. But one thing you can be sure of is that all of it will come to pass in time. Nothing in the Bible will fail to be true. The earth isn't forever but your eternity with God when the earth's time is up will never come to an end. Well let's join Pastor Malcolm in Isaiah chapter 17 with today's edition of Sound Truth. Turn to the book of Isaiah chapter 17. I like Isaiah, I like the prophet Isaiah. You know that he spent most of his time in Jerusalem and he was a contemporary with Hosea and Micah. And as we've been pointing out, he was the prophet to the southern kingdom of Judah. We mentioned from time to time the northern kingdom of Israel, he prophesied about the northern kingdom of Israel. But he was the prophet to the southern kingdoms of Judah. And he was ministering to the folks of Judah there during the time when the Assyrians conquered the northern kingdom of Israel. This was a long time before Babylon became a world power. 96 years before Babylon became a world power. And yet Isaiah prophesied that they would be involved or Babylon would be involved in the judgment of Judah. And so he speaks about or prophesied about different nations, different countries, Babylon, Syria, Philistia, and Moab and demand. Moab and Damascus, Ethiopia, Egypt, Edom, Arabia, Jerusalem, Tyre. All these he prophesies about as God gives him the revelation in regard to these things. And so we come to chapter 17 and the prophecy is the burden against Damascus. And there are heavy words, burden means of course the heavy words, the prophecy of heavy words that have come against Damascus. Damascus is the capital of Syria. Now when you read through the book of Isaiah, I have to understand it's not all chronological. This has actually written 30 years before the prior prophecy. And there's sort of bundled themes that he has. And there are in the writings changes of style. That's what's called some people to say that more than one Isaiah. But there's years apart and they were written. And so we read of the burden against Damascus. The whole Damascus will cease from being a city. It will be a ruinous heap. So he's predicting the destruction of Damascus. The cities of a row are forsaken. They will be full flocks which lie down and no one will make them afraid. This means there's going to be a grazing area and there's not going to be any people around. The fortress also will cease from Ephraim. The kingdom from Damascus, the remnant and the remnant of Syria. They will be as the glory of the children of Israel says the Lord of hosts. And so speaking here that this also speaking here of the northern kingdom of Ephraim and they were both destroyed two years later than this. And it shall come to pass that the glory of Jacob will wane and the fatness of his flesh grow lean. It shall be as when the harvest gathers the grain and reaps the heads with his arm. It shall be as he who gathers heads of grain in the valley of Ephraim. Yet gleaming grapes will be left in it like the shaking of a novellif tree. Two or three olives at the top of the upper most bow, four or five and it's most fruitful branches says the Lord God of Israel. So it is basically saying very little left after harvesting. He means by that there'll be very few people left or survived this. In that day a man will look to his makeup and his eyes will have respect for the holy one of Israel. You have to ask the question what will it take for people to turn back to the Lord? I think as you study history of great revivals America has been a land of great religious revivals in the past. And you sort of pray that it might be so in the future or not to distant future we hope. We have much time left. And what will it take though for American people to turn back from the broken systems of this world? And once again turn to the fountain of live in water. You got to wonder whether it's going to be that we will have to suffer some hardship if there's going to be another revival, if there's going to be a... It has to be a change in society, a change in culture where people are sort of looking, start turning and looking to the"

I'm glad you're interested in what we have to say as we try to serve the Lord Jesus Christ. And if you would ever be so inclined to help us financially, you can do that at wolc.com. All right, good morning everybody. I'm glad to be in the house of the Lord too. Welcome. Last Sunday, we saw the baptism of Jesus. This is what happened next. The next day Jesus was standing with two of his disciples. And as he watched Jesus walk by, he said, behold the Lamb of God. When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. When Jesus turned and saw them following, he said to them, what are you seeking? They said to him, rabbi, which translated means teacher. Where are you staying? He said to them, come and see. They came and saw where he was staying and they remained with him that day. It was about four o'clock in the afternoon. Four o'clock in the afternoon. Now the previous day, John had baptized Jesus and said, behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. Jesus is the sacrificial Lamb of God who takes the sin of the world upon himself and carries it down into death. Jesus leaves sin in Hades and raises humanity with himself. The great church father, St. Ambrose, said in the resurrection of Christ, the world arose in him. That's what this icon is about. In the resurrection of Christ, the world arose in him. In the book of Revelation, in the fifth chapter, John wept because no one was worthy to break the seals, to open the scroll, and read God's proclamation of redemption. But then the elder said to John, do not weep, behold the lion. Of the tribe of Judah has conquered and is worthy to open the scroll. When John turned and looked to what the elder was pointing toward, John didn't see a lion. Instead he saw a lamb slaying but standing again at the center of God's throne. Jesus is the lion of Judah because he's in the lineage of David, the lion being the symbol of the tribe of Judah, from which David comes and then the kingly lion. So Jesus is the lion of Judah because he's in the lineage of King David. But Jesus doesn't conquer like David did. How does David conquer? Well, he kills the Philistines and kills a bunch of more Philistines. Some of Malachiites now and then. That's not what Jesus does. Jesus is the lion because he comes from the lineage of Judah. But he conquers not as a lion but as a lamb. He conquers in his incarnation, crucifixion and resurrection. So the sin of the world is not conquered by killing the bad guys. That's what we think. The world is not right. We'll kill the bad guys. The world will be right. Wrong. That'll just keep the world the way it is under a different name. The sin of the world is conquered in the way of the lamb in his incarnation, crucifixion and resurrection. Well, on the day after Jesus' baptism, John the Baptist is standing with two of his disciples. One of them was Andrew. The other one is not clearly identified, but I take it to be the narrator. I take it to be the evangelist, John, who composes this fourth gospel. I'm going to think of it that way. So John the Baptist, having baptized Jesus the previous day, is standing with two of his disciples, Andrew and let's say John. And Jesus is walking by and again, John the Baptist says, behold the Lamb of God. These two disciples, John and Andrew, then begin to follow Jesus. They have originally been disciples of John the Baptist, but with the second time that John the Baptist says, behold the Lamb of God, they begin to follow Jesus quite literally. Walking behind him as Jesus has traveling down the road, they're walking behind him. Eventually Jesus realizes that two men are following him. He turns to them and he says, what are you seeking? Ah, this is significant. What are you seeking? John begins his gospel, you know this. In the beginning was the Word. These are the first words we hear from the Word in the gospel. These are the first words of Jesus in John's gospel. We've been introduced to the Word who was with God, who is God, who took on flesh, who then is baptized by John and begins his ministry. But the first time the logos of God, the Word of God speaks words. He asks these two disciples, what are you seeking? This is the definitive question that the logos presents to all of us. What are you seeking? Here you are. You're in your life. It's happening. You've been given the privilege of existence. It's a mystery. You sort of arrive and you don't quite know what's going on. You've arrived in the middle of something. But then we began to become curious. We began to look what are you seeking? What are you looking for? Success, fortune, fame, happiness, power, what are you seeking? I mean, what do you want? What do you want? How you answer that question in honesty? How you answer that question determines a whole lot about your life. Seek it, you will find. But what are you seeking? What do you really want? What ar"

And so we'll dive into the book today in chapter one where Daniel and his three friends are taken captive and drug off to Babylon in this first siege. So there's a there are a lot of great lessons here in Daniel one about just simply refusing the world and I just want you to get the picture of Daniel as this young Jewish man who has grown up in Israel but is captive by a foreign enemy drug off to a land that he's never been to they speak a language he doesn't know they're eating food that he's not familiar with he's captive in this prison and he has every reason to accept what the king is trying to give him and he denies it because it goes against what God wants him to do and so we're going to learn a lot about this or through this event and I hope it's encouraging to you on refusing what the enemy would ask would offer you out of this world in our lives today because it's very applicable so let's pray Father I thank you so much for this time together and God I just pray that you would bless our study in your word this morning as we go through Daniel chapter one. God I thank you for preserving this book for us Lord as you told Daniel in chapter 12 to seal up the book until the time of the end and Father we're here we've we have made it to this point we're all the way thousands of years in the future in 2026 and Lord this book is every bit as applicable and exciting to study today as it was when you wrote it through Daniel all those centuries ago and so Father I just pray that these lessons would not be wasted on us that God you would use them to build up our most holy faith on your word Lord because of Romans 10 17 faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God and Lord we need to build up our faith on your word today more than ever to stand against what the enemy is trying to push into this earth at this time and Father I just pray that you'd use this this book of prophecy to teach us to give us eyes to see and ears to hear what your spirit is doing in this world today and Father we thank you for it and your precious name we pray Jesus amen amen okay so we've got to we've got to lean on the Holy Spirit so that out of first on 227 28 if you have the Holy Spirit the annoying that that abides in you teach you everything out of the word of God then we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming as it says in verse 28 so the way you have confidence and to stand unashamed before Christ is to build your life on the word of God and only the word of God there is there is no faith in anything else and if you'll just listen to what God says not what other people say says and not what you hope he says because it fits some narrative you've built in your head then then you will be a refined vessel fit for service that will not be ashamed when Christ calls us home in the rapture or when you take your last breath whichever comes first and that's actually a part of the mission statement that the Lord wrote for this church is to foster strengthen and grow an unashamed bride for Jesus' return and the only way to do that is to get the word of God back into the body of Christ so that we are on the meat of the word growing according to what God wants us to have in a study and not anything else if there's anything in my lifetime for sure that the church has been lacking in almost every church I've been a part of my whole life it's simply just studying the Bible and it's really heartbreaking because it's the one thing and the one most important thing that we should build our lives on as Christians because in the beginning was the word and Jesus is the word the word became flesh and tabernacle amongst us according to John 114 so we should be studying it and how often according to act 1711 we should be studying it daily so it's a daily routine you've got to wash your mind with the regenerative water of the word daily and take it in daily and build up your life so that you can stand against whatever this world is throwing at you and you see things I mean just think about where we were six years ago this month kind of hearing about something going on in China with some coronavirus and and then all of a sudden the world got shut down in March of 2020 and a lot of Christians around the world I'm not saying any way specifically here in Oklahoma City but just a lot of Christians around the world fear and panic took over their life and it should have never done that if you if you would have been in the Bible studying the Bible and building up your faith then you can stand when the enemy throws things like that at us in the world at the church so"

You're the one who illuminates things who gives us eyes to see and ears to hear. And so Holy Spirit, we welcome you. And Lord, I ask that this wouldn't just be another time where we kind of go through the motions, but God, I ask that we would hear from you. We would come to this place and we would meet with our maker. And so God, would you use your word? Would you use me? Lord, I pray that I would decrease, that you would increase, that the flesh would be no part of this. But Lord, that your word would reign and God, that your spirit would speak and God, maybe it's not even something I have to say, but Lord, maybe you're just going to deposit a thought in somebody's heart today as they're sitting in your house. So God, we're open. We just submit our hearts to you right now and we're thankful. We're thankful that you're a God that still speaks. You speak through your word and God, we want to hear your voice. And so Holy Spirit, we welcome you. We thank you for this time and we pray this in the name of Jesus, amen. The title of this message is collateral damage. Before we dive in, I need to recap a bit for you. You might be new. This might be like your New Year's resolution. You're like, let me come check out this church's cavalry chapel on Broad Street. And so if you're here, you probably aren't familiar with where we're at on our passage. And really, the truth is after Christmas, everything's kind of a blur. Maybe you've forgotten some of the stuff that's happened in 2 Samuel chapter 13, 12, some of the things that have happened recently. And so in order to rightly divide the word, we need to have context. And so I want to give you a little bit of context exactly where we're at. Within the last few chapters, we've seen David fail miserably. You may be familiar with the story. David takes for himself another man's wife. He impregnates her and then he successfully plots the murder of her husband. This is by far the greatest failure of David's life. And from this moment on, David and his family would never be the same. This failure would haunt him for the remainder of his life. And though he would ultimately be forgiven by God, the consequences of his sin would be significant. It was Nathan the prophet himself who made this clear to David. He essentially said to him, the Lord has forgiven you. However, you will pay a dear price for your sin. The consequence of his sin was that from this day forward adversity and disaster would rise from his household. His household was going to be sh- it was going to be shambles. And this has already started to take place. Last week we saw a tragic event occur between David's oldest son, Amnon, and his half-sister, David's daughter, Tamar. In summary, Amnon, David's son raped his own sister and after this took place, she fled and found refuge with her brother, Absalom, another one of David's sons. As you can imagine, Absalom was filled with rage after waiting two years and seeing David passively do nothing, did nothing over what Amnon did with his daughter, Tamar. He absolutely did nothing. Absalom decides to take matters into his own hands. Absalom, he devises "

In the meantime, grab your Bible and enjoy the teaching. Alright, so some years ago, thank you, we're ready to go. Yeah, I'm not the leader by the way, I'm brand new, I'm new here so I don't know what I'm doing. It's just never done this before. Yeah, some years ago, it's about four or five years ago, I think I remember the context, but it was it was just impressed upon my heart. I guess as a pastor who realized this as I looked out, the only one who knows what's coming this year in your life of my life is God. And I was sort of hit with this fresh again. Last Sunday as young Jesse was preaching, I was doing a funeral for just one of my dear, dear friends and one of my few fans and when you've got a few fans, you don't like to seem leave, right? You know, they're going off to heaven. A real, a precious 84-year-old Janice Boydston and this was her service and she would get up at the end of every service and she'd pop her head in and she'd give me a grade. She was a lifetime educator. She'd let me know how I did at the end of the message and I'll miss that forever. I was away with my family right after Christmas and I got a text from her son, Mama's home, she's, I'm like, we just spoke before I left. Sitting in her wheelchair, if she told me once, she told me a hundred times, pastor Frank, I don't know why the Lord just doesn't hurry up and take me home. I don't know how he gets he did, you know. She's sitting there, they found her and she was, she was home. And it just kind of, it just once again reiterates the fact that this thing that we, this life that we live is this is the frail, this is the, this is the place where bodies break down, this is the place where marriages can fall apart, this is the place where our dreams can be shattered. This is where it goes, this is where, thank God it's the short leg of the race, right? Thank God that this is the short leg of the race and what's ahead as eternal. But if, if you wouldn't mind, just sort of, and we've done this for the last, I think four years, this might be our fifth year. Just a show of sort of outward public humble, you know, submission to God. We might start the service with our hands in the air, just sort of as an act of surrender saying, I don't know what's coming, God, I have no idea what's coming and I know that this life could, it can just be a phone call and our entire year can start not the way we wanted it to start, right? We can be gripped with, we can be taken, we're on a mountain top right now, we can be in the darkest valley tomorrow. So I just felt led to start the service as it's been my habit first time in the the new year with our hands up in the air. Now if you're Presbyterian and you're like, do I, I'm not, I don't know, I don't know what comes next when you take your hands up. You could just put your hand just so he sees, just maybe in your lap even, even just turn your hand ever so open so that you are never associated with the Pentecostals. But maybe we just start as with a demonstration of like, Lord, I could you just be merciful to me, I'm so frail, you see what's around the corner I don't, prepare me even now for what it is that's coming and maybe even, maybe even, you know, go ahead and navigate some of those things that might otherwise just crush us. So if you feel comfortable with that, let's just start the year that way. Father in heaven, we lift our hands to you just as a symbolic gesture that we are so needy. We are not wise, you alone are wise. We're weak at the strongest of us compared to you are profoundly frail. You're a rock. We're nothing like that like sand we can shift and change. You never change. We don't see what's coming. We have no idea what's coming. And on the one hand that that can be a bit unsettling. And we don't, we're not called to live in fear but in faith. So we just pause right now with our hands up to you Almighty God, omniscient God, omnipotent God and ask that you'd be merciful with our frail, frail frame and our nature continue to be patient with us. Can and pour out mercy and grace upon us and will give you all the glory for a great year. We bless you, we trust you, speak to us now, your sons and daughters and all God's people say, amen, amen. Okay, so here we are. If you're joining us for the first time, we are glad that you're here with us. You're jumping into sort of the tail end of an epic saga.

I can already tell you that second service on a bad day is going to beat you. And third service, I don't know lightly. That's Paul and Chad got it right. It's right right down the alley. Can you beat this for? All right. Well, Leviticus chapter 11. Let's go there. One quick announcement. And I want to just be somewhat brief about it. Actually, I'll talk about that in just a second. Let me just get past the announcement regarding the women's event or the women's study. That is tomorrow, ladies. It is not too late to sign up for that. We think that this is going to be a really good, really good study going through a really good subject. That's first and second Peter. You don't want to miss out on it. We've got a lot of studies lined up this time around. And Karen Johnson, I was just talking to her about this the other day. She's very excited about teaching through it. I think that it's just been one of those passages that has sort of encouraged her a lot. I know when I was teaching through first and second Peter, it was phenomenal. I mean, it's such a great passage in the Bible to go through. And I for one just absolutely love anything that's going to talk about end times. And you're going to spend any amount of time in that. You're going to spend a lot of time in it, especially when you get to second Peter. And it's very, very, very, very worthwhile. So, okay. So please sign up. If you signed up previously for the previous study, you're going to need to sign up again this time around. So I just thought it would be good to let you guys know. And then also, there's a lot of questions coming my way right now, especially about what is going to happen in Iran. And a lot of the talk about what's happening, especially with some of the recent movements, taking place in the Middle East and some of the policy statements being made, especially by, especially with the statement that the president just made pretty, pretty, pretty aggressive. Just be on the lookout this week. We're going to spend a lot of time analyzing that. There's a lot to talk about. And there's a lot on the horizon dealing with this. There's a lot of discussion happening back and forth. And so we're going to put in some real analysis into it this week for those of you guys that might be interested. This is going to be an interesting time for the people of Israel, especially if things happen the way I think they might. I keep telling David, I'm like, David, take, get back from Israel. You know, I mean, I know he lives there part of the time, but it's going to be an interesting time to see what happens to say the least. And we're going to provide some coverage regarding that and talk about the biblical precedent for it. I'll tell you this one thing. Okay. Anytime war breaks out anywhere in the Middle East, don't listen to the guys that says this is Ezekiel 38. Okay. It's a knot. You got to understand that. In order for Ezekiel 38 to even happen, you have to be in a condition of peace. There has to be peace all throughout to the point where Israel feels so confident about the peace that they have that they in essence remove their security around many of their cities. And that we're not we're absolutely not there. Okay. We're just not. So could that happen quickly? Certainly it could. But right now we're not there. And I don't I don't want the lies that oftentimes come up regarding what's happening based on people that don't know the whole truth with respect to what the Bible says to dramatically we influence how they interpret or how they see everything. And I think that that's kind of a dangerous sort of a dangerous place to be. So don't listen to a lot of that. That stuff is just generally wrong. Okay. Because the Bible gives us the formula and we have it and it's actually pretty clear. So with that, let's pray. Ask the Lord to go before us and we'll dig right in. Father heaven, we just thank you Lord for your word. We thank you for the opportunity that you've given us to dig deeply in your word Lord to understand and discern and know Lord what it is that you're saying. I just take a moment to pray that the words that I share would be your words Lord and not mine and that father you'd be glorified in and through what is said and what happens Lord. We also just pray God for insight and wisdom and discernment and understanding Lord that we would receive direction. And that we would be edified Lord based on the things that we're reading Lord even in a passage like this. There's so many that might read this and think it doesn't have a lot of value, but it certainly does. And we ask Lord that you would continue to inspire us Lord to understand it and to know exactly Lord what it is that you're communicating. So Lord, we just love you. We thank you Lord. We look to you and we ask these things now in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Okay. So we've been dealing with a lot so far as we've been going thro"

We are so excited to bring you a variety of topics from the fun and lighthearted stuff to even the more serious stuff that will impact together. Our podcasts will be available through video and audio so you can watch us or listen to us anywhere that you are. Now, here's the latest episode from the E-Media podcast. Come on, if you're glad to be in God's house today, find three people around you, give them a high five and tell them God is here, God is here, God is here, come on, tell them God is here, God is here, God is here. And he is, he is, he is where two or three are gathered together in the presence of God. There he is in the midst also. Come on, let's remain standing for the reading of God's Word. Come on, turn with me to Matthew, chapter five. Matthew, sorry, Matthew, chapter six today, starting at verse 19. Let's turn there. Matthew, chapter six, starting at verse 19 and those. Welcome to church today as we have been in a sermon series called The Red Letterway. Have you enjoyed this series so far? As we, okay, four people, let me ask again. Have you enjoyed this series so far? Okay, there we go. There we go. All right, all right, here we go. You almost had a late night last night, right? It's Valentine's weekend. Let's wake up, amen? Too much chocolate last night, right? So we've been focusing in, really in January on a journey with what Jesus said, you know, many times in the scripture where you see the red letter, it's what Jesus said himself. And so we've been on a journey as a church starting in January that's running us really through May, focusing on the five things that Jesus spoke on the most and really diving into the words and letting them transform us and then sending us out to be the church. And so we are on really the third saying we started with what? Being? How to be with God? We just finished up last week. Didn't Pastor Jake do an amazing job last week on forgiveness? Awesome job, Pastor Jake. We talked about forgiving, yes? And then today we dive into the third word that Jesus spoke on really more than anything we're going to talk on. He talked about money and possessions and giving really more than anything in the New Testament. So today we're starting that third word on giving. Somebody say giving. So today we begin a mature adult conversations about money. Can we do that today? A lot of times when we hear that word money or giving or possessions, a lot of times there are preconceived notions that come into our mind of what has been portrayed to us. And I understand when you see the crazy TV preacher at 3 a.m. talking about send me money and I'll send you the miracle spring water. Come on how many have seen that before? Or you send me money and I'll send you to prayer handkerchief and that I've prayed over and you're going to receive healing. No wonder we have this thought or this notion of what we think it is. And so my job the next three weeks or so is to really give us a theological framework on what finances mean. A biblical example of what Jesus said of what finances are to really help us gain an understanding. Because until we gain understanding until we really don't know what it says biblically we will remain in ignorance. Hello somebody. And what we are not informed on we will remain ignorant in. And so what we've got to do is begin to reframe what we think and put it back on what the word says. And hopefully that's why you came today. Is that why you came today? You came because you want the truth of God's word. You did not come for a patty cake, patty cake, baker's man. Treat me as sermon as quick as you can. Roll it and pat it and mark it with an S for a sermon for me. No that's not why you came. You didn't come for three points and a poem did you? How many came for the truth of God's word today? And that is why we are here. And so we're going to look in scripture. So today our journey starts us in Matthew chapter 6 starting at verse 19. I'm going to read this whole section through verse 33 of what Jesus said and let the truth of God's word settle on our hearts today. Are you ready for a journey today? So if you are a guest welcome to your first Sunday at Emmanuel starting at verse 19 it says this. Do not stir up for yourselves treasures on earth where moths and vermin some translations say or rust destroy where thieves break in and steal but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where moths and vermin do not destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal for where your treasure is there your heart will be also the eye of the lamp of the body the eye is the lamp of your body if your eyes are healthy your whole body will be full of light but if your eyes are unhealthy your whole body will be full of darkness if then the light is within your darkness how great is that darkness?

To the angel of the church in Smyrna right now Smyrna is modern day, is mere. It's the third most populous city in Turkey. To the angel of the church in Smyrna right, these are the words of him who is the first and the last who died and came to life again. I know your afflictions and your poverty, yet you are rich. I know the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan. Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. Now let that sink in for a moment. If the Lord appears to you and say, don't be afraid of what you're about to suffer, I think we'd all probably be afraid. Then he says this, I tell you the devil will put some of you to prison to test you and you will suffer persecution for 10 days. Be faithful even to the point of death and I will give you and this is very personal, I will personally hand you the crown of life. He or she who has an ear, let him hear what the spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes will not be hurt at all by the second death. Father, that's the promise that I want to thank you for the most. The second death has no fear because we won't experience it because we believed you because we put you in your right position in our hard sword. We're saved. Our sins past, present and future are forgiven and we're on our way to heaven. O Lord, from the example of the church at Smurne, let us do it with courage and by the strength of your spirit, move us to be active in sharing our faith. Lord, speak to our hearts. We've come to hear from you today. There's anybody in this final service today, Lord, who doesn't know you because it's so cold, so many are watching online. Lord, if there's any there who aren't yet born again, then knock on the door of their heart and ask them to be yours and add to your family. Nothing could bring you greater joy. We love you. We thank you and we honor you and all of this we pray in Jesus name. Amen. In February of 2015, 21 Egyptian construction workers, regular people, they weren't priests, they weren't evangelists, they weren't clerics, they weren't anything. 21 Egyptian construction workers were taken into captivity by ISIS and they were forced to kneel on a beach in Libya where they filmed their execution. The execution was by beheading. These were ordinary people and all they had to do to save their lives was to recant their faith in Jesus Christ. It's all they had to do. They were optic Christians. Now I know there are people saying, well, you know, the Coptic Orthodox Church, they have all kinds of doctrinal difficulties and it's true. But I think all 21 of those men demonstrated their faith was genuine because they refused to say, I won't believe in Jesus Christ and all they had to do to save their lives. Think of the courage that took. Think of the number of angels that were there present but unseen. Think about the numbers of angels, the myriads of angels looking out over the edge of time and space to applaud their heroism though it cost them everything. They refused to compromise their faith and they became 21st century martyrs. The church at Smyrna is the persecuted church. That's what they represent into the second and third centuries historically. A church where it was dangerous to be a Christian, a church where every day you were faced with danger. The church that we really frankly don't recognize because what we live in the 21st century and the West and San Antonio, Texas and we don't face it kind of persecution. And the natural thought is, would my faith survive? Well, I don't know. You and God, that's between the two of you. But here's what I know. We could be facing persecution, not that kind of severe. You know, one of the things to keep in mind when you hear a Bible study like this one is Acts chapter 17 verse 26 where it says that God puts us where we needed to be at exactly the time we needed to be here in order to find God. That means it's not an accident that we're here. We're here because this is our mission field. This is where God has chosen for us to serve. It also means something else about us. It means we're whims because it's pretty easy to do what we do here, not so in Smyrna. You know, Jesus said the people hated him and they will hate you. Well, I didn't do anything. Well, neither did he. I mean, he did miracles and he saved lives and transformed families. But they hated him. He said they've insulted me and they will insult you. A teacher is above the student. If the teacher suffers so too will the students. Where's students? Where's the disciples of Jesus Christ? So all of this, while it's sort of something that we can look at from a distance and say, boy, that was really tough to be a Christian. With all of my heart, I hope this doesn't sound silly to some of you. But I believe that in our nation right now, we're getting close to a time. We're doi"

If you're only just teaching through the Bible, you can't avoid anything. So Revelation chapter 2, beginning in verse 18, through verse 29, the end of the chapter, would you read along with me please. To the angel that is, you remember to the pastor, the messenger, of The Church of Thyatirate, right. These are the words of the Son of God, whose eyes are like blazing fire and whose feet are like burnished bronze. I know your deeds, your love and faith, your service and perseverance, and that you are now doing more than you did at first. Here it is, nevertheless, I have this against you. You tolerate, if you have a King James, it says, you allow. You tolerate that woman, Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. By her teaching, she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrifice to idols. I've given her time to repent of her immorality, but she's unwilling, and you want to highlight that word unwilling. So I will cast her on a bed of suffering, and I will make those who committed adultery with her suffer intensely, unless they repent of their ways. I will strike her children dead, then all of the churches will know that I am He who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds. Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, to you who do not hold to her teaching, and I'm not learned Satan is so-called deep secrets, and in parenthetically He adds, I will not impose any other burden on you, only hold on to what you have until I come. To Him who overcomes, and does my will to the end, I will give authority over the nations. Now, verse 27 sometimes can be a little confusing, but it just describes the authority that we're going to have over the nations in the millennium. He says, he will rule them with an iron scepter, the overcomer, will rule them with an iron scepter, he will dash them to pieces like pottery, just as I have received authority from my father. I will also give him the morning star. He and I always add she, who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. Father, you loved us enough to give us hard messages. We're grateful that you love us enough to give us encouraging ones as well. Today, Lord, it's a hard one. Holy Spirit, would you open our hearts? I ask that you remove any unwillingness at all, Lord, that remains in this room. I pray that your Spirit will move us to repentance. No beds of suffering here, Lord. Please, merciful God. And I also pray, Father, if there's anyone in this second service, maybe anybody coming to the next service, if they don't know you, if they're not yet born again, I pray, Lord, that this would be the day that they would surrender their hearts to you. You promise us a blessing, Lord, if we read this book, a greater blessing if we do what this book says. And I pray that that Spirit of obedience will rest upon each and every one of us today, for your glory, oh God, how we love you. Bless this time, the teaching of your Word, and Jesus' name. Amen. When I'm good news and bad news, the good news is, and you can hear the coughing and the sneezing going around. The good news is, only 20 more days of Mount and Seed are. Yay! You think it's said for you with Mount and Seed are trying having a microphone in your face all the time. But there's also bad news. And the bad news is trouble. Oh, we've got trouble. Right here in River City, with the capital T in that rhymes with P, and that stands for pool. Now, those of you who are young, Google it. One of the great musicals of all time. But you see, we live in the River City, don't we? That's what our nickname is. And we've got trouble, but it's not a P trouble. It's the T trouble. And that T is for tolerance. We live in a time where we just value tolerance and getting along with people more than almost anything else at all. You know, live and let live. What's the big deal? If people love each other, well, that's what this particular letter to the church that Thyatira is all about. Pergamum, you'll remember, was a compromised church. Thyatira is a corrupt church. Because of the prophetic implications, chapter 1, verse 3, it's a church that has profound implications for each and every one of us. To the angel of the church in Thyatira, right. Now, this is the longest letter of the seven. I think it's ironic that it is addressed to the smallest church of the seven in the smallest city. Thyatira, unlike Pergamum, was a small and almost inconsequential city when historian labeled it a city that is irrelevant. It was located about 34 miles southeast of Pergamum. It was located on a major Roman road. And developed a reputation for commercial business. It was what we would call today a union city. It was where people worked with their hands and the trades. And you'll see later how that factors into Jesus' letter. It was best known for its production of Die, its mention in the"

Again, we ask that you would open your word to our hearts of fresh. Lord, as we go through this opportunity for one generation of the church to hand to the next generation of the church, wisdom, understanding everything we need for life and godliness, we might now how to conduct ourselves within the household of God. I pray you'd use this book a first Timothy to transform our walk with you. You draw as close to your Lord, may we sense more of your presence, hear more of your still small voice in our hearts, perhaps Lord in this time, be more effective for what you desire to do through our lives than we've ever been before. So come and minister to your church through your word we pray in Jesus' name. Amen. First Timothy, man, do it one way. Okay. This is one of several prison epistles. Timothy, Titus, second Timothy, Fy, Lehman, all written by Paul while in prison, but also so too Ephesians, Philippians and Colossians. But not only did he write to certain churches, he also wrote to certain individuals. And so first Timothy is one of those early letters that he wrote during his imprisonment. And of course some of you are like, what's he doing in prison, how do you get there? So rather than just go through the book of Acts, let me sum up. How's that? So how many of you remember Paul in Acts 21 came to Jerusalem with alms that he had brought to bless the church when he got there James and the other said, hey, there's this sort of word out there on the street about you, you're teaching people of forsake Moses to turn away from basically the law of God and all that. And other were just sort of turning away from the Old Testament. And what are we going to do? So we've got these guys who made a vow, do us a favor, go with them, pay their expenses for their sacrifices. Be with them as they sanctify themselves, come to the end of the vow and everybody will know that this is untrue, that was said about you. And so doesn't tell us well that Paul thought it was a great thing, he did it. And there are almost the any pity, almost there. And some Jews, some Asia Minor, otherwise known to you and I as Turkey, claimed that Paul brought trophamous past that dividing wall from the court of the Gentiles into the court of the Jews only and to do that is a death penalty. And so they raised this riot saying he's brought a Gentile past the burial wall and it tells you in the book of Acts is they were going about to kill Paul. So they're just beating us not out of them, licensed the commander up in the fortress Antonia, seized the problem, comes running in, breaks the whole thing up, grabs Paul, brings him in, they're about to basically beat him and scourge him and he says, hey man, I'm a Roman. And so they bring him the next day in front of the sand, Hendren, Paul makes one statement, the whole thing erupts into a giant argument, they bring him back that night to the prison and word gets out that there's an assassination hit team that is going to make sure Paul's killed dead. Lices, here's about this. Mill the night sends them out, sends them up the Cessarri Amirotima there, the governor has his home. Paul gets there to meet Felix who's in charge at the time and Felix reading what's going on says we'll keep you here until Lices comes up. Well for about two years he's sitting there in Cessarria by the way this last trip to Israel we got to see the prison they had him and they found it. Yeah they just keep digging but that's in the side first service in here. So they get him there and Felix interesting guy, he steals Drusilla King of Grip the second sister who has dropped dead gorgeous, steals her seduces her away from her husband, makes her his own, Paul preaches the Felix about self-control, God's judgment which freaks him out. Any eventually gets recalled to Rome and Festus takes over, you know him as porquies Festus. How do you forget a name like that? Festus goes down to Jerusalem, see the Jews, take care of his governorship, they complain about Paul, they want him to come down so they can try him there because they want to kill him. Festus talks to Paul about it and says hey listen how about we go down and have this hearing in Jerusalem and Paul says listen buddy modern translation I'm at Cessar's judgment seat you can't deliver me to them as you well know that's it I appeal the Cessar and that's it all records are sealed everything's closed Paul gets put on a boat they head to Rome they get shipwrecked at Malta eventually they get on a boat and he arrives in Rome everybody's still with me. He is given to the captain of the guard and only a short period of time whereas there one the captain of the guard his name is Buris Afernis and he died in 62 which means Paul had to get the Rome by 61 to be in charge of the captain of the guard what does that mean to you? Well he probably then had all his troubles somewhere around like late 58 early 59 spends two years in Cessarria"

I'm your host, Lisa Phanima, and I can't wait to dig into God's truth with you today. Let's get grounded. Happy 2026 listeners. We are back. We did take a break after the holidays to regroup, but we are ready to start the second half of season three, and I am so excited. I cannot wait for you to hear what we have planned. And I know we are well into January already, but I think most of us are still kind of in organization and fresh start mode. I know I am, although I'm not nearly on top of things as much as I'd like to be. But at best, I probably would call myself a Type-C personality, which is controlled chaos. Since I've had kids, it's pretty much the best I can do. I'm not sure if anyone else can relate to that or not. But, so to help me and the rest of us kind of get our acts together and maybe to get back on track in the new year, I thought I would invite someone on the podcast who is gifted in this area and has a lot of us, a lot to teach us. And the person I thought of immediately is Hickory Creek's own Alicia Kavanaugh. So, I think many of you may already know Alicia. She's a longtime member of Hickory Creek Church, but she's also the newly appointed Bible Study Coordinator. And that means, what does that mean, Alicia? What does the Bible Study Coordinator at Hickory Creek Church do? Well, I'm still learning, to be honest. But at this point, it's a matter of discerning studies with the other Bible Study leaders, planning when they're going to be, what the schedules are going to look like, who's going to serve in the teaching capacity, who the table leaders will be, who or maybe some coal leaders that could come alongside them. So, it's a lot of administrative organizational type things, right, which is perfect, which is why you're here today. And in fact, I know that you are gifted in this area because when we were talking one time, I think it was after the workout class, you were sitting over by Laura Kertcher, the pastor's wife, and we were chatting about Thanksgiving. And I discovered through conversation that you had a spreadsheet to organize your meal prep for the week. Am I right? You're right. Yeah. And so then I knew you were the girl for the little embarrassing. I thought that was amazing. And so opposite of the way I approach Thanksgiving, that is for sure. So Alicia, you are a mother of five. And I know that you are also a leader over at the Bible Study Fellowship chapter in Orland Park. But can you just tell us a little bit more about yourself, kind of let our listeners know? And even some of the members of our church get to know you a little bit better. Sure. Yeah. So I have been married to Kevin for almost 31 years. Wow. That's incredible. It is. Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. We met at Illinois Wesleyan University. We met in Dr. Stories Old Testament class. Okay. That's a whole story in and of itself. But that's where we met. We got married in 95. We have five kids. Our oldest is Caitlin. She's a graduate from Moody Bible Institute and she is newly married to her husband Gautham. Then we have a son Colin. He is currently at the Ohio State University Moritz School of Law. So he's getting his law degrees. He's in his second year. Wow. Our third child Cameron, he graduated from Indiana Wesleyan. So different than us. Same initials but different school. And he's an assistant band director at a school in the Muncie, Indiana area. Okay. And then finally we've got two in high school. Coleman's a senior at East and Carson is a sophomore at Lincoln Way East. Yeah. We have that in common because I have a senior daughter and a sophomore daughter. So our kiddos are the same age but different schools. We're at the other Lincoln Way. One of the other Lincoln ways. So you know, that's five kids. Five kids is a lot of kids. So I have to ask you, you know, knowing that this organization skill is something that you have. Is that something you've always had or is that something that was like necessary because you had such a large family? In hindsight, I wouldn't have known this in the moment but in hindsight it's something I've always had. Okay. Yeah, I would say if anything with five kids I had a lighten up a little. Oh really? So tell me more about that. What do you mean when you say that? Why do you have to lighten up? There's just certain things that aren't realistic. You have to let go of certain things and be okay with that. Yeah, that is true. You know, there's going to be clutter some days. There's going to be crumbs on the floor. There's, you know, going to be piles of laundry, maybe wrinkled clothes, you know, just certain things like that that are just going to happen. Yeah. I mean, a lot of you that you actually have to do like three times because it is that and then just wash her for way too long and starts to smell. Exactly. Well, I think that's what I'm so intrigued by because I can't even imagine myself with five kids. It feels "

And in some cases, big things that are happening in other countries that the news media didn't cover, like what's happening in Iran right now. We can pray for our brothers and sisters in Iran. But all that to say, one of the things that's humorous to me as we hear the news from other countries is how human nature is eerily the same from nation to nation, regardless of cultural differences. So take, for instance, a New Zealand man named Ivan Segaden, right now Ivan, I don't know if he moved in from Russia or whatever, but that was his name, he was in New Zealand. And Ivan didn't like wearing a seatbelt. Now I'm not gonna ask for a show of hands, but I would imagine some of you kind of may fall into that category and you're like, not gonna wear it this time, no matter how much my car screams at me. And so New Zealand, like Alabama, is a click it or ticket kind of place, right? And so over a period of five years, the police gave Ivan 32 tickets for not buckling up. But the tickets didn't work. Ivan refused to buckle up. And finally, Ivan actually got the idea that he thought was smart. His problem was in his mind, I'm spending all this money on tickets. It's really affecting my Starbucks budget and my date night budget, I guess, maybe I don't know if that's what he's thinking. And so what should the solution be? Now if you're thinking to yourself, it sounds like Ivan should wear a seatbelt. Then friend, you are too common-sensical for Ivan. Ivan developed an idea where he would have, and this isn't actually Ivan or his necessarily his idea, this is actually a shirt that foolish people, I'll temper my language, that foolish people would wear, instead of wearing their seatbelt, Ivan just came up with one of these deals that when he got in, he made a fake seatbelt strap, he just kind of throw over his body, and so he quit getting tickets. Now the problem was that it didn't really affect Ivan's driving and his trick worked for a while. He didn't have to pay any more tickets, but that doesn't mean it didn't cost him anything. In fact, tragically, Ivan paid with his life in a head-on collision with a tree, where that fake seatbelt did not prevent him from being thrown forward into the steering column and that the actual seatbelt would have stopped. And so discussing the accident, the coroner described the fake seatbelt. He said, though his car was fitted with seatbelts, an extra belt with a long strap had been knotted above the seatbelt on the driver's side, providing a belt to simply sit over his shoulder. Now while there are a number of lessons that we could learn from Ivan today, here's one that you may not be thinking of, when truly tested in this life, what is fake will fail. When truly tested in this life, what is fake will fail you. Or maybe to put it another way is that truth matters. Truth matters. You will ultimately be held accountable for how you live and for what you believe, how you live and what you believe. Accountability for how you live and what you believe, in fact is woven into creation and you could just add to that by the creator. So over the past few weeks, we have had the opportunity to hear the most important message ever declared from four different witnesses. The good news about Jesus Christ describes what's most important to God concerning our redemption. And then his initiative to restore us to his purposes. And last Sunday, in the book of Acts, we saw the incredible power of the Holy Spirit unleashed into the early church, thus continuing the ministry of Jesus and fulfilling the great commission to take the gospel to Jerusalem, to Judea, and to Alsemaria, and to the ends of the earth. And what we see now being played out in the rest of the New Testament is that where the news about Jesus is embraced, where the news about Jesus is embraced, real life as God intended is restored. But where this news about Jesus is rejected, brokenness continues. Let me say that again, because that's really the starting point for the rest of the New Testament, where the news about Jesus and those four gospel accounts, where that news is embraced real life as God intended is restored. But where this news is rejected, where this news is rejected, then life continues to be broken. The gospel is a fork in the road that has eternal consequences. That's why the New Testament authors go from simply describing the gospel, because you think, I mean, if that's the most important message, then why not just have the book of Acts that talks about how the church started and then maybe revelation and how everything ends and then what's the purpose of the middle? It's because they went from describing the gospel to defending the gospel because of this truth, because what you believe matters, you can sincerely believe lies and it still destroy your life, right? But if you believe "

God's Word says this, consider from this day onward, from the 24th day of the ninth month, since the day that the foundation of the Lord's temple was laid consider, is the seed yet in the barn, indeed divine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree have yielded nothing, but from this day on I will bless you, say bless you. The Word of the Lord came a second time to Haggai, from the 24th day of the month. Speak to Zerubabul, governor of Judah, saying, I am about to shake the heavens and the earth, and to overthrow the thrones of kingdoms, I am about to destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations, and overthrow the chariots and their riders, and the horses, and their riders shall go down every one by the sword of his brother, on that day declares the Lord of hosts. I will take you, O Zerubabul, my servant, the son of shield, teal, declares the Lord, and make you like a signant ring. For I have chosen you, say chosen you, chosen you, declares the Lord of hosts. This is the Word of the Lord. Amen. That's where I ask the other for the reading of God's Word. Amen. We see it. I have visited and seen with my own eyes the Taj Mahal more times than I can count, and to be honest, I'm over it, which is why it was fascinating to me about a year ago. When a few of our staff went to India together for a vision trip to visit some of our mission partners there to encourage them, when of course they have never seen one of the man-made wonders of the world, and they wanted to see the Taj Mahal, and I get it, I understand, but I was over it. This beautiful structure under the vision and the leadership of Shah Jahan took 22 years to build, over 20,000 workers. His vision was that it would be a place that would inspire awe and imagination, divine beauty. He wanted people when they saw it for the first time to experience paradise of heaven, but on earth. It was meant to evoke wonder. It was so interesting, as I saw the rest of our group going to the Taj Mahal, and they got dressed up. They wanted to look the Indian way, and I just got up wearing my American sweatpants. And I walked, and they were taking photos in every possible angle. I have seen the Taj Mahal at sunset. I have seen it at sunrise. I have seen it at lunch. I've seen it at every hour of the day. When I tell you I'm over it, I am over it. But I was fascinating watching them looking at this for the first time. And I thought to myself, when did I lose the wonder of this place? To a far greater degree, I wonder how many of us walk into the church, and we've lost the sense of awe. We've lost the sense of wonder, the gathering of God's saints, God's people, together being formed together into the likeness of Jesus, stewarding the mysteries of God, but in many ways, we're over it. But I imagine the disciples of Jesus in Matthew chapter 16, when they heard for the first time, that Jesus says that he is building his church, his Echlesia, his called out ones, the gathering of his people, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. The power of the Romans, the weight of spiritual religiosity, all the evil of the world cannot withstand what God is building. In the church and I wonder if their minds were filled with wonder, with imagination, of what God can do when those who have confessed the Lordship of Jesus gathered, when those who have been baptized in the life, death, burial, resurrection, ascension, and enthromant of Jesus gathered to exalt Jesus. When we as the Apostle Paul says, the church has been given the mandate to share the manifold wisdom of God to the rulers and the authorities. This is what the Apostle Paul says in Ephesians chapter 3 verse 10, meaning God's plan is that through the church, God's wisdom would be made known. What is God's opinion on every matter? We live in a world right now with so much debate on what's truth and what is not truth, then God has given the church the mandate to extend to the world what God once done in the world. And while we may not be perfect, this is God's plan for us. In fact, if you find a perfect church, you should leave, you'll ruin it. I love what Dr. East and Lee Jones says. He says the church has many critics, but no rivals when it comes to the work of human redemption in the world. About a hundred years ago, a group of destitute, extremely poor women in the village of Mizoram in India became followers of Jesus when they heard the good news of the gospel that they were not their cast. They were not their past. They were not the sum total of what other people said that they were. So moved by the gospel, so moved by the spirit of God in them. They wanted to contribute to the advancement of the church, to the planting of churches, to the supporting of missionaries globally. But what could they do? What could poor women do? Every day, they would take a ration of their rice and they would hold it in their hands. It became a practice known as Baha'i Th"

Today Pastor Rob Branchflower will be sharing with us insights into God's Word. So let's prepare our hearts and minds as we dive deeper into the living truths of the Holy Bible. All believers have been sent by God to be ambassadors or representatives of Christ. We're not all sent to the same place, but all of us have been sent. In our text today we see the first officially sent missionaries in the Book of Acts. Now previously Philip, Peter and others had certainly done missionary work, but this marked a change where the local church and in this case the church in Antioch became the official missionary sending body. That the local church is the missionary sending organism or body of the church. That God designed missionaries not to send themselves, but to be sent out from the local church. In our text today we're going to gain some principles about how God calls and sends us out as missionaries and how he works in and through us as he does. And the first thing we see in our text this morning is this, God calls. God calls. First one. Now there were in the church at Antioch prophets and teachers, Barnabas, Simeon, who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manin, a lifelong friend of Herod the Tetrarch and Saul. While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, set apart from me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them. It's important to understand that God is the initiator of the calling to mission. Now there's a general call to mission to all believers. All of us as believers in Jesus Christ have been given a general commission. We call it the Great Commission. We find it in Matthew chapter 28. All of us are called to go into the world and make disciples baptizing the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit and teaching them to obey all that Jesus commanded. That's a command to every single Christ follower. I would even go so far as to say this, there is no such thing as a follower of Christ who isn't called to make disciples and live on mission for him. That's God's general calling for every believer. In addition to the general calling to all believers, God also calls believers to specific missionary callings. This is the case in our text today. We saw in Acts 11 that Saul and Barnabas spent a year in Antioch teaching and making disciples. They were so effective at making disciples in Antioch that it was there that followers of Christ were first called Christians. Think about that. They were so good at making followers of Christ that they started calling them little Christs. As Saul and Barnabas were busy doing the work of ministry and making disciples in Antioch, God called them specifically to be sent out from there as missionaries. They were to take this message of the gospel that they had been discipling the believers in Antioch in. They were to take it on the road or on the seas. Obviously no airplanes back then, so they were traveling by boat and traveling by land. As they were faithfully serving, God gave them a specific calling. As they were specifically serving the general calling of God, God gave them a more specific calling. Verse 2 tells us that while they were worshipping and fasting, the Holy Spirit spoke to them about their calling. And this specific calling was obvious not only to Saul and Barnabas, but to the other leaders of the church as well. God spoke a clear and specific calling for which the church was to ordain them. Notice it wasn't the church or the leaders who called and ordained them. It was God. It's very much like this. God had called Saul and Barnabas to go out and the church said, yes, we agree. This is what the Lord is saying. It's critically important when sending and ordaining people in ministry that the local church, that the leaders believe they're hearing from God. Is God the one who called them? Yes. But are they the only ones who believe that God called them or is that calling evident to others as well, especially the leaders of the church? That's important. If we are God appointed, we are God anointed. That's the good news. The bad news is if we are self-appointed, guess what? We're self-annointed. That's not the anointing I want. I don't want the anointing of Rob because guess what? That's got nothing. That can do nothing. To be self-appointed and self-annointed is a scary place to be. That's why it's important that those who have a specific calling from God, that that calling is witnessed to an effort. We are witnessed to an affirm by the leaders of the church. We do that whenever we raise somebody up, whenever we send somebody out, we would never send somebody out who said, hey, I want to be a missionary and nobody else agreed. That's not a good thing. If you say, hey, I'm called to be a pastor and everybody around you goes, hey, I'm called to go on the mission field and everybody around you goes, hmm, I don't think so. That's a serious warning sign. God is "

All right, well, we already prayed, so we won't have to start with that again. So did you like doing the study? Was it a little bit harder than the one before? No, not too bad. Okay, how about the one before? God provides. A little bit more challenging, a little bit? No, okay, well good. Yes, well this is going to be a very emotional book. I was telling Nicole, I said this is going to be really harder to teach because there's so much talk about persecution and waiting through the persecution. And we don't like to talk about persecution because we don't like persecution. And unfortunately, we're kind of wamps when it comes to persecution because our idea persecution is somebody being mad at us at work, persecution back in Bible days where they were being eaten by lions. It's a little bit of a different situation. So, okay, all right, so coming off of what we started two weeks ago in the introduction, that the theme of this book we talked about, and there's many, many different themes in the book, but they all blend together. We walk through many of them as we did in the intro. So many believers during this time that Peter was talking about the persecution. So many of the believers, Jewish believers, were going back to Judaism. And they were doing this because they were waiting for Jesus to come back. They thought he was going to come back right away. And they were waiting and now it's been so many years and they're just going, you know, I don't know if we want to continue with this. There is so much persecution against Christians. And if they just went back to Judaism, the Romans were tolerating the Jews, but they hated the Christians. So in their mind it was like, well, we are Jews and we did accept Christ, but if we completely went back to Judaism, it'd be safer for us and safer for our children. They just wanted to go back to the way they were raised. And some of the Jews who had accepted Jesus as their Messiah were being persecuted and their faith was being tested daily. So Peter in this book is telling these scattered believers because they had been scattered everywhere. To find joy and strength and to find their security in Christ and to have that eternal future focus. Now I've shared with you before that when Pastor Jeff went to be with the Lord that the only thing that kept me sane during that time of missing him was that oxymoron sort of world I lived in where death is the worst thing you can go through. But it's also the best thing you can go through because, and you know what oxymoron means, it's the same event that brings different emotions. And I would think this is not how I wanted to live my life, but Jeff is living his best life. And I know for a fact he doesn't want to come back to this life, even though I wanted to come back. I would have loved that, but I don't know. And I've talked to so many widows and I go, do you really want your husbands to come back? And I go kind of and it's like, you know, they don't want to. They don't want to hear that. Because every widow wants to hear the year husband wants to come back and be with you. But really the truth is they don't. But these are scattered believers. And they were everywhere. And Peter is, you can see all the names of the places that he talks about in chapter 1, verse 1. And he's calling them to come back and to endure suffering for the sake of Christ. This call is also for us today. This is not just for back then. This is for us today because we have a different type of persecution. But the horrific things that went on in Rome during that time were unbelievable. You got to remember Rome ruled the entire world. Caesar was God. The Christians were told you must reverence Caesar as God and they just wouldn't do it. Persecution was increasing, so was their faith. Rome was a cruel taskmaster. If any of you seen any movies about Rome, Gladiator was one of them, where you can see what they would do. They did those not just to the Gladiators, but they did horrible things to the Christians. Again, Rome would tolerate Jews, but they would not tolerate Christians. Christians were hated and the hatred was growing every single year after Jesus died. There was so much hatred toward the Christians. The Romans believed that the Christians were dangerous. They made everything so much worse than it was. Sounds like Democrats today. They were called irrational. They were considered a cult. Christianity. Christians, like I said, they refused to worship the Roman gods. This was treason or sedition. They were in big trouble for not bending their knee to the Roman gods. Anything that happened in Rome, or they didn't know who started the fires or what went on, they blame the Christians. Plagues, disasters. Anything that happened in a day, they blame the Jews. They told the entire community that Christians were cannibals. They turned communion into something very ugly and something that was li"

Today on SoundTruth with Pastor Malcolm Wilde, Calvary Chapel, Mayor at Island. As he sees all of this from a different perspective and it's heartbreaking to him, heartbreaking that not just that the people are surrounded by the Assyrians under siege, but the fact that they don't seem to be going about the whole thing the right way. Instead of being repented, they are partying and looking at them on their rooftops. Nations will rise and fall in the end times. It's prophesied in the Bible, which means that it will come to pass. You can see the scene play out in the world today as it lines up more and more for these events to take place. The important thing to know going into the end times is that you don't have anything to fear if your trust is in Jesus for salvation. Today, Pastor Malcolm is going to share how not everyone in those days will repent and turn to Christ, but there's hope for you in Christ, so you have nothing to fear. Well, let's join Pastor Malcolm in the book of Isaiah 20 with today's edition of SoundTruth. Let's turn to Isaiah 20. In the year that Tartan came to Ashtard when Sagan was the king of Assyria, the king of Assyria sent him and he fought against Ashtard and took it. We've been talking about Assyria quite a lot, the Assyrians, and if you're wondering, where the geographical place of Assyria would be today? Well, it would span actually Syria, the area of Turkey, Iran and Iraq. That would be the place of the Assyrians. That does not mean to say that Syria, Turkey, Iran and Iraq and that you should call those people Assyrians today. They are long gone. When he says Tartan here, this is the title of a commandering chief under Sagan. And Ashtard of course is on the coast of Israel and it was a strong city of the Philistines. At that time the Lord spoke by Isaiah the son of Amos saying, go and remove the sackcloth from your body, take your sandals off your feet, and he did so walking naked and barefoot. Now of course the prophets wore, prophets like Isaiah wore these skins, the camel skins, and with the bristle inside and usually wore a tunic underneath that. I remember when David was dancing before the Lord when they were bringing the Ark of the Covenant back to Jerusalem, where his wife, Mikhail, sort of insulted him because he was uncovering himself in front of the Maidens, and not that David was naked or stark naked. But he had the common tunic. There are a lot of people believe that's what Isaiah had on, that he wasn't stark naked. But he had on a undergarment and he took off the regular garment, walked around like that. But it says naked. So deal with it. It is what it is. The Lord said just as my servant, Isaiah's walk, naked and barefoot three years for a sign in a wonder against Egypt and Ethiopia, so shall the King of Assyria lead away the Egyptian as prisoners and the Ethiopians as captives, young and old, naked and barefoot with their buttocks uncovered to the shame of Egypt. So Isaiah then really walking around this way is sort of a walking illustration and a powerful one too, I guess. The point being that the tragic news is that the Assyrians will lead them away captive in such an awful way. Then they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia, their expectation and Egypt, their glory. And the inhabitants of this territory will say in that day, surely, such is our expectation wherever we flee for help to be delivered from the King of Assyria and how shall we escape. When we come to chapter 21 of Isaiah, we come now to speak of the destruction that will come upon Babylon, Adam, Arabia, that will actually come from the Meadow Persian Empire. But that will not take place for another 200 years from this prophecy when Babylon falls to the Meads. Later on in the 45th chapter, we have more detail about this prophecy and about this fall of Babylon. Intracure prophecy, even naming the Meadow Persian general who will conquer Babylon, a couple hundred years before it actually happened. Cyrus is named there in chapter 45. We'll talk more about that when we get there, when we get to that chapter, but it's sort of fascinating to think of this man being named. Daniel actually telling them, hey, did you know you were named? So, verse 1, the burden against the wilderness of the sea as well wins in the South pass through, so it comes from the desert from a terrible land. The Babylon, because it's known as the desert of the sea, an area where the Tigris and Euphrates come together. A distressing vision is declared to me. The treacherous dealer deals treacherously and the plunderer plunders. Go up, O'ealum, besiege, O'media. All its sightings have made to cease. Euphrates was the name used then because Persia wasn't the name that was even used, but that is who was talking off here along with the Meads. And Persians are not even prominent yet.

And in some cases, big things that are happening in other countries that the news media didn't cover, like what's happening in Iran right now. We can pray for our brothers and sisters in Iran. But all that to say, one of the things that's humorous to me as we hear the news from other countries is how human nature is eerily the same from nation to nation, regardless of cultural differences. So take, for instance, a New Zealand man named Ivan Segaden, right now Ivan, I don't know if he moved in from Russia or whatever, but that was his name, he was in New Zealand. And Ivan didn't like wearing a seatbelt. Now I'm not gonna ask for a show of hands, but I would imagine some of you kind of may fall into that category and you're like, not gonna wear it this time, no matter how much my car screams at me. And so New Zealand, like Alabama, is a click it or ticket kind of place, right? And so over a period of five years, the police gave Ivan 32 tickets for not buckling up. But the tickets didn't work. Ivan refused to buckle up. And finally, Ivan actually got the idea that he thought was smart. His problem was in his mind, I'm spending all this money on tickets. It's really affecting my Starbucks budget and my date night budget, I guess, maybe I don't know if that's what he's thinking. And so what should the solution be? Now if you're thinking to yourself, it sounds like Ivan should wear a seatbelt. Then friend, you are too common-sensical for Ivan. Ivan developed an idea where he would have, and this isn't actually Ivan or his necessarily his idea, this is actually a shirt that foolish people, I'll temper my language, that foolish people would wear, instead of wearing their seatbelt, Ivan just came up with one of these deals that when he got in, he made a fake seatbelt strap, he just kind of throw over his body, and so he quit getting tickets. Now the problem was that it didn't really affect Ivan's driving and his trick worked for a while. He didn't have to pay any more tickets, but that doesn't mean it didn't cost him anything. In fact, tragically, Ivan paid with his life in a head-on collision with a tree, where that fake seatbelt did not prevent him from being thrown forward into the steering column and that the actual seatbelt would have stopped. And so discussing the accident, the coroner described the fake seatbelt. He said, though his car was fitted with seatbelts, an extra belt with a long strap had been knotted above the seatbelt on the driver's side, providing a belt to simply sit over his shoulder. Now while there are a number of lessons that we could learn from Ivan today, here's one that you may not be thinking of, when truly tested in this life, what is fake will fail. When truly tested in this life, what is fake will fail you. Or maybe to put it another way is that truth matters. Truth matters. You will ultimately be held accountable for how you live and for what you believe, how you live and what you believe. Accountability for how you live and what you believe, in fact is woven into creation and you could just add to that by the creator. So over the past few weeks, we have had the opportunity to hear the most important message ever declared from four different witnesses. The good news about Jesus Christ describes what's most important to God concerning our redemption. And then his initiative to restore us to his purposes. And last Sunday, in the book of Acts, we saw the incredible power of the Holy Spirit unleashed into the early church, thus continuing the ministry of Jesus and fulfilling the great commission to take the gospel to Jerusalem, to Judea, and to Alsemaria, and to the ends of the earth. And what we see now being played out in the rest of the New Testament is that where the news about Jesus is embraced, where the news about Jesus is embraced, real life as God intended is restored. But where this news about Jesus is rejected, brokenness continues. Let me say that again, because that's really the starting point for the rest of the New Testament, where the news about Jesus and those four gospel accounts, where that news is embraced real life as God intended is restored. But where this news is rejected, where this news is rejected, then life continues to be broken. The gospel is a fork in the road that has eternal consequences. That's why the New Testament authors go from simply describing the gospel, because you think, I mean, if that's the most important message, then why not just have the book of Acts that talks about how the church started and then maybe revelation and how everything ends and then what's the purpose of the middle? It's because they went from describing the gospel to defending the gospel because of this truth, because what you believe matters, you can sincerely believe lies and it still destroy your life, right? But if you believe "
