41,4e492843c465beef,1308,7254,en,whisper_local,base,v1.0,"2026-02-18 04:05:38","Welcome to the Curious Faith Podcast. Faith is the absence of questions. It is learning where to take them. In each episode we tackle one honest question and seek a biblical, thoughtful answer. My name is Ryan Johnson and my curious companion for today's episode is Mr. Jonathan Light. Jonathan how you doing? I'm doing well. How are you doing? I'm doing good. I'm doing good. Thank you for joining me in this inaugural episode of the Curious Faith Podcast and I'm excited to venture out. And so Jonathan, let's just get at it. What is today's question? All right. So today's question for the inaugural episode is why start a podcast built entirely around questions? What a great question, Jonathan. Well, you've heard me say it often. If you're a member of a God-pay Baptist church here in Scottsboro, Alabama, I love questions. I love questions wherever I am. And because we all have questions and a lot of times we have questions about things that are spiritual in nature, but we are either afraid to ask them. We don't know who to ask. We don't want to ask where people know that we're thinking that because we're afraid of people thinking that we're doubting. And so I really think a core part of my ministry is really to help people understand that questions aren't a threat to faith, that they're invitations to deeper faith. If you're not asking questions, if you're not curious about what you're reading in scripture, if you're not curious about the Christian life, then you're probably not operating off of an active faith. And so this podcast really just exists to take one honest question for episode and dig deeper and answer it biblically and clearly. I'm not trying to win arguments. We're not trying to gain favor with anybody. We're just trying to get clarity and confidence as we walk on this journey and discipleship. And so that's the goal of podcast. It's just to help you think clearly and believe confidently and follow Jesus faithfully. Awesome. Awesome. So the curious companion, what exactly is that role? Well, it is. That's your role, Jonathan. At least in today's episode and in the future, we may have a couple of curious companions on here. But just to make it clear the nature of the podcast, the curious companion is not a debate opponent. We're not trying to trap skeptics, obviously. It's not scripted fluff. You are the voice of curiosity, right? So whereas I'm curious to hear the questions and to answer the questions, your response is follow-up. You're essentially the voice of the listener of the podcast and you're trying to anticipate the person who asks, you know, but what about this as I answer and then want you to press me, you know, when something needs clarification. So the if you're listening to this podcast, the curious companion represents you. It's the person who's listening and thinking, okay, but I don't get this part. So they're going to do follow-up questions in your honor. But this format is really about like creating clarity. You've heard me say that a couple of times now. And it's one question for episode because we're really not trying to rush through, you know, bullet point answers. We're striving for depth over breadth. If you all, if you do know me, you know that I am typically not concise. And so this podcast is trying to force me into a place to be concise. And so these episodes are going to be about 12 to 20 minutes per episode. And I hope by doing that, we will not only help you see this podcast as accessible, but as something that you can just build into your day and to your routine as podcasts are prone to do. Absolutely. And past around, where are these questions coming from? Well, they are coming from past events that I've done. They are coming from conversations that I've had with people. I'm not sharing details about the people who are asking questions, but it's really just about the question itself. If there's any relevant context, of course, we'll give that. But the goal is just to answer questions that have been asked to me. And the questions that we're going to start with are questions that have been asked during the live services at Agape. We have the QR code on the screen during every service so that people can ask those questions. And the hope is is that we'll start with the questions that people have asked most recently. And then we will get into some of the questions that I've encountered from the past. And so yeah, that's really where the questions are coming from. So the idea, folks, is that we want to kind of make a commitment to you that when you queue up this podcast that you can expect and answer from scripture, you know, you can you can know that we're going to be clear. We're going to be charitable about about where Christians disagree. We're sure multiple viewpoints. If that's what you need to know in terms of the question that's been asked, obviously, I love questions. That means I have to love hard questions, right? Which I got some incredible questions at the most recent event that I did about about God and time and God's holiness and then life in general about having kids and all kinds of things. And these are from teenagers, right? So I can promise you, we won't dodge those hard questions. We also won't pretend every issue is simple and we're very transparent to help you understand and let you know that maybe I don't have the complete answer. Maybe there's there's certain things that we face that that is much more complex than we can deal with in this short amount of time. But I'll be very honest about that as we as we go through these episodes. And so just just to understand, we want to help you think deeply, not teach you what to think, right? We're not trying to answer questions as a way to tell you what to think. But what we do want to model how to think, you know, in fellowship as as as brothers in Christ and then also just as those who go back a scripture, but not just try to quote chapter in verse for everything as a simple answer, you know, we're not throwing the proverbial Romans 828 grenade into the midst of situations and expect to solve the problem. But instead we want to just walk through the answer as best we can and invite participation from our listeners to ask those questions. And so I hope eventually the questions will come from the people we were listening. And so that's the goal of what we're doing. And just from the outset, know that this this podcast, Curious Faith is sponsored by a Gapay Baptist Church in the Community Care Village, which is the nonprofit that was started out of a Gapay Baptist Church. And it's basically where faith meets action in our community. That's the goal for us is to help people see some of the things that are happening out of a Gapay Baptist Church here in Scottsboro, Alabama. So if you are listening to this podcast, we want you to email your questions. Obviously, press that subscribe button. And maybe share it with somebody who has asked you a good question or who might also be somebody who asked God a questions about faith, because that's ultimately the goal. And so I'm Ryan Johnson. And my curious companion for the day is Jonathan Light. And we will find you on the next episode of the Curious Faith Podcast. Thanks for"
76,fff27fa6b5ef676a,2857,14646,en,whisper_local,base,v1.0,"2026-02-18 12:09:28","Hello and welcome to the her salad ground pot cap. I'm Lisa Vanama, your host and I can't wait to dig into Gads Truth through today. Let's get grounded. Well listeners, I wanted to start today off with a little bit of a confession. It's always good to start a conversation with a confession, huh? Lean in a little closer. It's not that big of a deal. But I have a little bit behind in my podcasting. Typically, I am several weeks out, sometimes months out on topics and recordings and lately because of life and just getting adjusted to the new rhythm here at the podcast. It's been sometimes a week by week thing and the schedule is a little bit tight. But the benefit of that has been that as I have chosen topics, I really have been able to take a step back and look at our world or what we as a collective church are experiencing in this moment and really try to speak into and maybe minister a little bit to that specifically. And I do personally feel like the last several weeks have been a little heavy. I mean, let's be honest, last couple years have been a little heavy but I don't know if about you, but I feel like there's been a lot of noise in this world over the last several weeks. And it's exhausting. It's heavy as believers and lovers of the Lord. I feel like many of us take that very personally. We know that division and conflict and pain and hurting is not anything that the Lord wants for our world. He wants us to be at peace and he wants us to be united in him. And so it grieves him when he sees this world hurting and I think it grieves us when we see this world hurting because we have the Holy Spirit inside of us. And so I was thinking back to a few years ago when I was going through a similar season personally where things just felt really heavy. I was taking life pretty seriously and I was definitely weighed down by a lot of worry and overthinking and stress. So I decided that the remedy for this was to paint my front door blue. That sounds a little bit crazy, right? But it really might not be even a big deal to some of you. But remember a couple episodes ago when I told you that I'm more of a neutral girl. I choose safe things. And so choosing to paint my front door blue felt rebellious to me. It actually just felt fun. And now granted, in all things with my personality, you know, we don't change in overnight. And so of course I stressed over the color and shade of blue for three days. But I didn't let that deter me. I just felt like I needed to add some color to what felt like an endless season of gray skies and really deep reflection. I just needed some levity and somehow painting my front door blue felt like the next right thing. And honestly to this day, that front door makes me smile. It reminds me not to take life so seriously all the time and that sometimes simple joys can make all the difference. And so I wonder if maybe that's a word for you today. Maybe you are a little weighed down by the noise of the world or maybe you've been stuck in a season of your own life that feels especially draining. And you're seeking some sort of levity. You know, maybe you're feeling financial stress or a relationship stress or parenting demands or work deadlines. They can very easily add up and steal our sense of joy and wonder. They can like suck the life out of us, right? I mean, you just need to spend two minutes on social media and you feel that chaos just come right in conflict crisis. You name it. It's right there and it can be disheartening. And so what it looked like maybe for you to take a step away and to have maybe a blue door moment. Sometimes when life takes over and our circumstances can dictate our mood, I think we need to get intentional about joy. And yes, the joy of the Lord is our strength and his eternal presence is our hope. But I also think he gave us creative minds and capable hands that can be used to reveal his glory and even unlock the joy in our everyday lives. I'm not saying that those simple joys should replace him, but I do think they can be used to point us back to him. And so I wonder if maybe that's something you could consider today for yourself. Please don't misunderstand what I'm saying here. I'm not encouraging you to check out. What I'm encouraging you to do is to intentionally lean in to the goodness of God. Because when I look around and see the beauty that he created for his own glory, I believe that he also created it for our enjoyment. The chirping of birds, the colorful rainbow after the storm, the seasons and those rhythms we can always count on. I think of the stillness and even the vastness of the ocean, breathtaking sunsets, the taste of fresh strawberries that all points to the goodness of God. Goodness it, we get to enjoy and even joy more when we remember who it all comes from. It tells us in James that every good and perfect gift comes from God. So maybe instead of feeling like we have to bear the weight of our family on our shoulders or the weight of the world on our shoulders, we could just take a step back and just instead look at the beautiful creation around us and enjoy some time with the Lord. I'm talking about simple choice and creative endeavors. Not talking about mountaintop moments. I'm talking about looking intentionally for God in the everyday beauty and opportunities he places in front of us. Because here's what I have found and I think probably a lot of you have found too, that there's just moments that feel so simple and pure that we can finally slow down enough and actually hear the voice of God. And so what starts off as a way of just kind of like breathing a little easier ends up being an opportunity to commune with God in a new and refreshing way. It's just almost like he hugs us in those moments and gives us a chance to just rest in his arms and in his presence. And feel happy in that and feel grateful in that and maybe even loved in that. And because God is so cool, of course my daily devotional kind of talked about that today. And it's the devotional is called my utmost for his highest by Oswald Chambers and I just love the way he kind of frames this idea. So here's what Oswald says and it's the title is the devotion of hearing. He says the goal of my spiritual life is such close identification with Jesus Christ that I will always hear God and know that God always hears me. If I am united with Christ, I hear God all the time through the devotion of hearing, a flower, a tree or a servant of God may convey God's message to me. What hinders me from hearing is my attention to other things. It's now that I don't want to hear God but I am not devoted in the right areas of my life. And so what is point here is that a flower, a tree, he can speak to us through all of those things. And I think that somehow in our minds when the world gets heavy or our own personal world gets heavy, we think that the holy thing to do is to worry about it and to ruminate on it and to keep scrolling and keep researching and some people like to keep commenting. And what I wonder is if maybe the real answer is to just withdraw and lean into God. Most of us have fallen into the trap of using screens as our only way of enjoyment or leisure. And we have forgotten the value of just taking a walk or creating something with our hands. And I think anyone who has ever spent time gardening or outside doing some good work, like even pulling weeds, there's something so satisfying about that. And it really does bring you closer to the Lord. And shutting off the noise and listening to the heart of God is always our best response. And that is part of the abiding work that we are called to. And I just want to remind us of that today that no matter what anyone tries to tell you on the internet, walking away and taking a deep breath and enjoying simple pleasures and moments in your life is okay. And it can center us in a way that our bodies need. No, it's not just taking a nap and getting enough sleep, it's resting in the Lord. And enjoying the beauty around us. This is part of what creation does just by existing. And they display the splendor of God and in what a kind God we have that doesn't just give us food to sustain us, but he makes it taste good. You didn't have to do that. But that's just who he is. And so maybe baking is the thing for you today. What could you do to just draw you back to your humanity and the goodness of God? And I was trying to think of a way I could help you do that. And there's a piece of scripture that I often read when I just need to be reminded of the wonder and the awe of God and His goodness. And it's Psalm 104. The first time I ran across it, I was just struck, I'm a word person. So the beauty and the poetry in these verses are so compelling. And I'm guessing that most of you probably haven't read any poetry today. Maybe a few of you, but I'm guessing most of us probably don't take the time to do something like that. And so I thought maybe I could do it for you today. Maybe I could just give you a piece of scripture that would fill your heart but also inspire you and maybe motivate you to lean into the goodness of God and the beauty that He has placed all around you. Psalm 104. Praise the Lord, my soul. Lord, my God, you are very great. You are clothed with splendor and majesty. The Lord wraps Himself in light as with a garment. He stretches out the heavens like a tent and lays the beams of His upper chambers on their waters. He makes the clouds His chariot and rides on the wings of the wind. He makes winds His messengers flames of fire His servants. He set the earth on His foundations. It can never be moved. You covered it with the watery depths as with a garment. The water stood above the mountains. But at your rebuke the waters fled and at the sound of your thunder they took to flight. They flowed over the mountains. They went down into the valleys to the place you assigned for them. You set a boundary they cannot cross. Never again will they cover the earth. He makes springs pour water into the ravines if flows between the mountains. They give water to all the beasts of the fields the wild donkeys quench their thirst. The birds of the sky nest by the waters. They sing them on the branches. He waters the mountains from His upper chambers. The land is satisfied by the fruit of His work. He makes grass grow for the cattle and plants for the people to cultivate, bringing forth food from the earth. Wine that glattens human hearts, oil to make their faces shine, and bread that sustains their hearts. And I wanted to end with verses 31 through 33. Is the glory of the Lord endure forever? May the Lord rejoice in His works. He who looks at the earth and it trembles, who touches the mountains and they smoke. I will sing to the Lord all of my life. I will sing praise to my God as long as I live. So good, isn't it? The words, the pictures and images it brings to your mind and you think about, you know, the Lord using cloud as a chariot. And also just the majesty and awe of who He is and how amazing His creation is and even just the idea of Him creating it. You know, the smoke that He brings from the mountains, it's just one of those times when we can just think, wow, look what God has given us. And so I hope that blessed your heart today. I hope that taking the time to enjoy scripture, not a half to but a get to moment and how could thinking about creation and being grateful for it inspire you to live a little different today? What simple action or joy could you participate in to the glory of God? Maybe it's just walking around the block and enjoying the creation and thanking Him for His work. Maybe it's doing a puzzle with your family and slowing down and pouring out your love and attention on those gifts He's given you. Maybe it's making yourself a nutritious meal or maybe it's baking muffins for a hurting friend. Maybe it's making your toddler belly laugh or bouncing a basketball with your middle schooler. Maybe it's painting your front door blue or red or bright yellow. Whatever your next right thing is, I pray that it reminds you that simple choice can be a part of God's work in your life. I truly believe our God is a God of details and abundance. He is a God of intricate pine cones and delicate butterflies. He is a God of crisp apples and furry animals and warm sunshine. He is artistic and intentional and he carefully plays beauty in plain sight. Beauty he created for all of us to enjoy, including himself. I mean, Genesis tells us that he walked in the garden of Eden in the cool of day with Adam and Eve and he even took a day off to enjoy his creation. So maybe today is a good day for you to do the same. Nope, it will not change your circumstances and it won't erase any pain or struggles you're going through and it certainly won't solve the problems of the world. But it might give you a much needed breather, a taste of joy and a gentle reminder that God's goodness is always near and always true no matter what color door we open to find it. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, I just stand in awe of your majesty right now. Your creativity and your kindness and that we see revealed in creation and everything all around us, whether it's a flower or a tree or a bird or our lunch or we are grateful for it all. We see your goodness in it all. You know, Lord sometimes this world gets really noisy and loud and tries to distract us from the fact that you are good and holy and on the throne. You call us to a life of hope and a life of joy in you, a life that might be hard but that we can always take heart because you've overcome it all. And although we may not feel like that right now, we can know that it's true and we can step away, we can spend time with you so that you can refresh us and renew us body, mind and soul. Help us, Lord, to have eyes to see your goodness. Give us the courage and the trust to step away from our everyday activities and just take a moment or two to be with you. We use our minds and our gifts and our creativity and our hands and our eyes and our ears, all of the senses were to really remember just how good you are. Forgive us for making worry our idol. We're spending way too much time on the screens of our lives. May we spend more time in the stillness of your presence and in the pages of your word. Help us, Lord, draw near to us, comfort us, give us peace and help us to hear your voice in all those moments of our day. Help us to intentionally seek you in and all in the name of Jesus, I pray. Amen. Listeners, let's delight in the Lord and lean into His goodness this week. He alone is our solid friend."
31,fca16f0da36b7c27,3529,18451,en,whisper_local,base,v1.0,"2026-02-18 03:46:52","Okay, for him and his family. Okay, turn to first Peter, chapter one. All right, well, we already prayed, so we won't have to start with that again. So did you like doing the study? Was it a little bit harder than the one before? No, not too bad. Okay, how about the one before? God provides. A little bit more challenging, a little bit? No, okay, well good. Yes, well this is going to be a very emotional book. I was telling Nicole, I said this is going to be really harder to teach because there's so much talk about persecution and waiting through the persecution. And we don't like to talk about persecution because we don't like persecution. And unfortunately, we're kind of wamps when it comes to persecution because our idea persecution is somebody being mad at us at work, persecution back in Bible days where they were being eaten by lions. It's a little bit of a different situation. So, okay, all right, so coming off of what we started two weeks ago in the introduction, that the theme of this book we talked about, and there's many, many different themes in the book, but they all blend together. We walk through many of them as we did in the intro. So many believers during this time that Peter was talking about the persecution. So many of the believers, Jewish believers, were going back to Judaism. And they were doing this because they were waiting for Jesus to come back. They thought he was going to come back right away. And they were waiting and now it's been so many years and they're just going, you know, I don't know if we want to continue with this. There is so much persecution against Christians. And if they just went back to Judaism, the Romans were tolerating the Jews, but they hated the Christians. So in their mind it was like, well, we are Jews and we did accept Christ, but if we completely went back to Judaism, it'd be safer for us and safer for our children. They just wanted to go back to the way they were raised. And some of the Jews who had accepted Jesus as their Messiah were being persecuted and their faith was being tested daily. So Peter in this book is telling these scattered believers because they had been scattered everywhere. To find joy and strength and to find their security in Christ and to have that eternal future focus. Now I've shared with you before that when Pastor Jeff went to be with the Lord that the only thing that kept me sane during that time of missing him was that oxymoron sort of world I lived in where death is the worst thing you can go through. But it's also the best thing you can go through because, and you know what oxymoron means, it's the same event that brings different emotions. And I would think this is not how I wanted to live my life, but Jeff is living his best life. And I know for a fact he doesn't want to come back to this life, even though I wanted to come back. I would have loved that, but I don't know. And I've talked to so many widows and I go, do you really want your husbands to come back? And I go kind of and it's like, you know, they don't want to. They don't want to hear that. Because every widow wants to hear the year husband wants to come back and be with you. But really the truth is they don't. But these are scattered believers. And they were everywhere. And Peter is, you can see all the names of the places that he talks about in chapter 1, verse 1. And he's calling them to come back and to endure suffering for the sake of Christ. This call is also for us today. This is not just for back then. This is for us today because we have a different type of persecution. But the horrific things that went on in Rome during that time were unbelievable. You got to remember Rome ruled the entire world. Caesar was God. The Christians were told you must reverence Caesar as God and they just wouldn't do it. Persecution was increasing, so was their faith. Rome was a cruel taskmaster. If any of you seen any movies about Rome, Gladiator was one of them, where you can see what they would do. They did those not just to the Gladiators, but they did horrible things to the Christians. Again, Rome would tolerate Jews, but they would not tolerate Christians. Christians were hated and the hatred was growing every single year after Jesus died. There was so much hatred toward the Christians. The Romans believed that the Christians were dangerous. They made everything so much worse than it was. Sounds like Democrats today. They were called irrational. They were considered a cult. Christianity. Christians, like I said, they refused to worship the Roman gods. This was treason or sedition. They were in big trouble for not bending their knee to the Roman gods. Anything that happened in Rome, or they didn't know who started the fires or what went on, they blame the Christians. Plagues, disasters. Anything that happened in a day, they blame the Jews. They told the entire community that Christians were cannibals. They turned communion into something very ugly and something that was like eating the flesh of Christ and the blood of Christ as cannibalism. We know that it was all very symbolic. Christians were seen as a direct threat to the empire. We know that the Romans were brutal in so many ways. Burn Christians alive. They would put them in the arena with wild animals just for show. There is a tradition, which I don't know if this is true or not, but I'm sure if Paul had the chance to do this, he actually, at one time, was able to go to Rome and speak to a group of Christians before they went in to the arena with the animals in the morning. One of the little boys said, can we ask, is this going to hurt when the animals come and attack us? He said, yes, but only for just a very little time and then you're going to be with Jesus. Can you imagine telling a little four or five year old little boy that, well, we don't have that kind of persecution ladies. We can't even imagine. The practical application for us is that Paul is encouraging us to live a joyful endurance in our suffering. We would find our true and complete identity in Christ. Everyone needs to know that we're Christians. If your coworkers at work don't know you're a Christian, you need to tell them you're a Christian. Our identity is in Christ. Finding our identity and pursuing holiness, living by his grace in this terrible hostile world. No one wants to suffer. I don't want to suffer. I know you don't want to suffer. But according to Peter, this is expected of us that we will have persecution in our lives and that we should be able to have endurance through it. We know that the slaves that were torn from their own countries and brought to this country. When they heard the gospel message, that was the only hope that they had of a better life. Most of them that came over from the African nations along the Cossero were Muslims. But when they came to America and they were in a Christian environment, as much as you could be in a Christian environment as a slave, but they heard the gospel. And that was their hope. They worked 12 hour days, most days. Their whole life and their only hope was if they would love Jesus that they would see the blessed after life. We know some of the old slave songs are deep, deep with words of comfort. Death was the only entrance that they had to a better life of peace and forever rest. A life built on hope of Christ. This was their only joy of a heavenly home. Now we don't have this kind of persecution. And if people can have that kind of hope in that type of persecution, what is wrong with us that we cannot handle such minor persecution that we go through? It's going to get worse. We're going to have to, as we go through this book, we're going to have to get a little bit stronger ladies. We're going to have to be bold and brave because it is going to get worse. We'll be a time, hopefully not in our families, but there will come a time when children will be turning in their own parents, like they did in Nazi Germany. It's going to happen the word tells us so. Peter is also clear that his life and our life were just passing through. We're strangers. We're living in a world but we don't fall to the worldly system. Being holy and living a holy life will help us to avoid us conforming to this world. Just living a holy life and being in the Word will counteract us being tempted by the world. If you're being tempted by the world, if you're being stretched to do things with your worldly friends or going to bars or whatever it is, I don't know what people get tempted to do today. I've been out of the world so long. I don't know even know what the temptations are. But I know this, by living a holy life, that world becomes further and further away from you. Don't you want to live like that? Don't you want to live a holy life to where when temptation comes knocking on your door, that it's almost like we don't even answer the door. You don't even look through the window to see who's knocking. You already know and you just leave it alone. That's the kind of life Peter's talking about. That's the endurance, the strength that he wants us to have. I don't know about you, but with AI and all the fake news, I don't really know sometimes what is truth. Do you get confused? You know the little 30 second little commentaries that people put on. I just get confused. Sometimes you just have to not watch it. You have to stay so close to the truth because the lies of the enemy look very true. And when you hear people say things like, well, that just sounds reasonable. Well, that just sounds like something maybe I would like to maybe look into. You're being tempted. Don't be tempted by things that you know, you know once you hear it, you know there's something wrong with it. Don't go investigating. We daily need to ask the Lord to fill us with his Holy Spirit. We need more reliance upon the Holy Spirit. For what? Wisdom, his knowledge, his truth, evil is not the little devil running around in the red suit. He is a tall, good looking man or woman. Looking very good. Sounding like a sound person. Sounds reasonable. Sounds like something I might want to look into. These one minute videos that get us messed up. We've talked about it before. I have someone in my family that says, I don't know what to believe anymore. I got to stop watching these things. Yes, just stop. Stay on the side of holiness. Peter is warning us that we need to be also his witnesses. We need to be a witness. And this is why I'm sharing with you. Ask the Lord if you have a problem being outspoken about your faith. Asking the Lord to fill you with his Spirit that he would give you the ability to be, remember when we're filled with the Spirit, the purpose of it is that we would be a witness for him. We need to be a sounding board. When people say, how are you? Say, I'm doing great. I'm doing good. I just love Jesus. Can I pray for you? We need to be bold and brave with our faith. This is part of what Peter talks about in this book. We need to be a witness for Christ. Which means we have to sand down and hone up our witnessing skills. When we first got saved, we were so bold and brave. What happened? He wants us to be a witness. He wants us to use our spiritual gifts. Do you know what your spiritual gifts are? I think we kind of, we know what we're gifted at a little bit. We know what our gifts are. If you don't look at spiritual gifts in the Bible, you'll be able to relate to a lot of them. The Lord wants us to serve him. The best place to serve is right here at church. This is where we can serve. If you don't know what to do here, talk to Nicole. In a church of this size, there's plenty to do. There will always be plenty to do. Lord wants us to serve to love deeply. We would love one another deeply. Get rid of petty stuff going on between families and your sisters and the Lord. It's nonsense. It's waste of time. Get rid of it. Gelicy. Love deeply. Practice hospitality. There are so many people that love hospitality, but there's a lot of people that don't. I have somebody in my family that I don't think I've been to her house in 20 years. She doesn't like it when people come over. She likes her carpeting clean. She doesn't like messiness. But on Valentine's Day, I probably had 20 people in my house and believe me, it was a mess when they left. Baby throw up. Food. I found a few diapers in places. Why did they put them back there? Behind the couch. What is that smell? It's life. It's fun. It's noise. Do you like noise? Do you like to wake up in the morning here, bicycles riding past your house with little kids screaming? I love that. I don't like the quiet. Practice hospitality. Be ready to give a gentle, respectful explanation for your faith. Now, we've talked before about our testimonies. The world will argue with this. The world is going to argue with this. But what can't they argue about? Our testimony. Because that's ours. And that's real. And if you're afraid to maybe share the word or you might think, I don't know the word that well, don't worry about it. Share your testimony. Nobody can argue with that. And you know that very well. To share your testimony with your neighbor when they come over for coffee, just say, you know, I've never shared with you about my life before I was, wasn't a Christian. You got 10 minutes, five minutes. I can just share a little bit. You know, listen. Having a respectful, quiet, gentle explanation. Part of your homework for next week, in addition to what you're doing is, I want you to contact somebody that you haven't talked to in a very, very long time. And you're going to call them and ask them how they are. And then you're going to listen. Does everybody have somebody they haven't talked to in a long time? Sure, we all do. We all have somebody that, gosh, I haven't talked to them. My high school friend or my neighbor that moved away or maybe your mom. I don't know. But just to call somebody and say, I'm just calling to see how you're doing. How are you? And then let them talk and you listen. And maybe I don't know if you're bold and brave. You can end in that conversation with prayer. We need to trust our faith muscles. I just heard today about a true story about Max Lucato, you know who he is. He's an author. He said in one of his books that he had a boat that he went out with a couple of his friends out on the ocean. And they found themselves in the middle of a hurricane. Yike. There was an old man who happened to be an old sea-faring man in the in the boat with Max. And he said, Max, it's going to be okay. But what we're going to have to do because I've been through this before is you're going to have to anchor down the boat with four anchors. One in the front of the boat on the side four anchors anchor that boat down. And then we're going to pray. And that's what they did. And they came out of that hurricane. The boat was intact and so were they because they had the their anchors were firm and they trusted in faith. These anchors are our faith. And we need to practice our faith so it will withhold during the storms in life. Now we all have anchors. But what are they when things when things pop up when things when these trials come up, where do you turn? Because we all have we all have different types of anchors. We need to turn to the Lord. Is your anchor your job? Your family? Maybe your skills? Maybe some connections that you have? I have some connections. Money? Everybody has anchors. But the Lord wants our anchor to be in him. And then when these come, we don't have to spend a lot of time figuring out who we're going to call. We just call on the one that we know will always answer and has promised to be there and he will never fail us and never leave us North for say. That's what's on my bracelet. That's scripture. I will never leave you know for say you. And you don't know how many times I just look down and go, I need to be reminded of that daily. When I was 27, my mother died right in front of me in the car, going to Bob's big boy for dinner. Just she just left. She had a massive brain aneurysm. It wasn't anything horrible. She just went to sleep. And my life was radically different from that moment on. My mother was the matriarch of the family. You have a matriarch in your family. Maybe you are that matriarch. My mother was for me and my life that day, that night, that Sunday night was over as I knew it. And I never could go back home again. Because my father remarried very quickly. And let me tell you she didn't like me. One bit. They took my key away immediately. But God wants us to be matriarchs in our family. He wants us to be good examples to our kids and to our husband, to our neighbors. Just in tonight reading just a couple of scriptures in first Peter chapter one verse eight says, whom having not seen ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your soul. And verse 13 we shared this two weeks ago, wherefore, gird up your loins of your mind be sober. We're not little girls. We talked about how to react. We don't react. We're not little girls. We're not crying, grabbing mommy's skirt. Be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former less of your ignorance. But as he have called you is holy. So be holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be holy for I am holy. Lord, we just thank you for your word because we can sense that Nicole picked this study because she wants us to take a step up. So Lord, we are saying again as we said two weeks ago that this is what we want. We want this to be a year that when we end this year, if you don't come, that we can truly say that we are in a much better place spiritually than we are today. And Lord, you're just going to be faithful to minister to us, to teach us, to love us, to carry us through the storms. Lord, you're our anchor and we are not letting go. We need you. We trust you. And we're going to throw you in the ocean when we need stability. Lord, we will not anchor our anchor on another boat. We're going to anchor that place where you're at. So we thank you Lord for this study. It's going to be challenging, but Lord, you're going to go before us and we thank you in Jesus' name, amen. All right."
65,1a0397ec38e539f8,3734,19935,en,whisper_local,base,v1.0,"2026-02-18 04:44:02","Hey everybody, this is Brian Zahn and welcome to the Word of Life Church sermon podcast. I'm glad you're interested in what we have to say as we try to serve the Lord Jesus Christ. And if you would ever be so inclined to help us financially, you can do that at wolc.com. All right, good morning everybody. I'm glad to be in the house of the Lord too. Welcome. Last Sunday, we saw the baptism of Jesus. This is what happened next. The next day Jesus was standing with two of his disciples. And as he watched Jesus walk by, he said, behold the Lamb of God. When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. When Jesus turned and saw them following, he said to them, what are you seeking? They said to him, rabbi, which translated means teacher. Where are you staying? He said to them, come and see. They came and saw where he was staying and they remained with him that day. It was about four o'clock in the afternoon. Four o'clock in the afternoon. Now the previous day, John had baptized Jesus and said, behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. Jesus is the sacrificial Lamb of God who takes the sin of the world upon himself and carries it down into death. Jesus leaves sin in Hades and raises humanity with himself. The great church father, St. Ambrose, said in the resurrection of Christ, the world arose in him. That's what this icon is about. In the resurrection of Christ, the world arose in him. In the book of Revelation, in the fifth chapter, John wept because no one was worthy to break the seals, to open the scroll, and read God's proclamation of redemption. But then the elder said to John, do not weep, behold the lion. Of the tribe of Judah has conquered and is worthy to open the scroll. When John turned and looked to what the elder was pointing toward, John didn't see a lion. Instead he saw a lamb slaying but standing again at the center of God's throne. Jesus is the lion of Judah because he's in the lineage of David, the lion being the symbol of the tribe of Judah, from which David comes and then the kingly lion. So Jesus is the lion of Judah because he's in the lineage of King David. But Jesus doesn't conquer like David did. How does David conquer? Well, he kills the Philistines and kills a bunch of more Philistines. Some of Malachiites now and then. That's not what Jesus does. Jesus is the lion because he comes from the lineage of Judah. But he conquers not as a lion but as a lamb. He conquers in his incarnation, crucifixion and resurrection. So the sin of the world is not conquered by killing the bad guys. That's what we think. The world is not right. We'll kill the bad guys. The world will be right. Wrong. That'll just keep the world the way it is under a different name. The sin of the world is conquered in the way of the lamb in his incarnation, crucifixion and resurrection. Well, on the day after Jesus' baptism, John the Baptist is standing with two of his disciples. One of them was Andrew. The other one is not clearly identified, but I take it to be the narrator. I take it to be the evangelist, John, who composes this fourth gospel. I'm going to think of it that way. So John the Baptist, having baptized Jesus the previous day, is standing with two of his disciples, Andrew and let's say John. And Jesus is walking by and again, John the Baptist says, behold the Lamb of God. These two disciples, John and Andrew, then begin to follow Jesus. They have originally been disciples of John the Baptist, but with the second time that John the Baptist says, behold the Lamb of God, they begin to follow Jesus quite literally. Walking behind him as Jesus has traveling down the road, they're walking behind him. Eventually Jesus realizes that two men are following him. He turns to them and he says, what are you seeking? Ah, this is significant. What are you seeking? John begins his gospel, you know this. In the beginning was the Word. These are the first words we hear from the Word in the gospel. These are the first words of Jesus in John's gospel. We've been introduced to the Word who was with God, who is God, who took on flesh, who then is baptized by John and begins his ministry. But the first time the logos of God, the Word of God speaks words. He asks these two disciples, what are you seeking? This is the definitive question that the logos presents to all of us. What are you seeking? Here you are. You're in your life. It's happening. You've been given the privilege of existence. It's a mystery. You sort of arrive and you don't quite know what's going on. You've arrived in the middle of something. But then we began to become curious. We began to look what are you seeking? What are you looking for? Success, fortune, fame, happiness, power, what are you seeking? I mean, what do you want? What do you want? How you answer that question in honesty? How you answer that question determines a whole lot about your life. Seek it, you will find. But what are you seeking? What do you really want? What are you looking for with this life that's been given to you? These two disciples, they give a pretty good answer. They respond to Jesus, question with their own question, where are you staying? The implication being, we just want to be where you are. What we're looking for is not something from you, it's you. We're not looking to get something from you. We're not looking for you to do something for us. You're not a means to do an end. You're the one we're looking for. Where are you staying? They are drawn to Jesus just to be with Him. Had a dream one time and in my dream I met Jesus. He asked me what I wanted. He called me by name. He said, Brian, what do you want? And I said, I want to be a part of what you're doing. I think that was a good answer. So Jesus says to these two, what are you seeking? Where are you staying? Common-see. Common-see. He doesn't tell, he doesn't give them an answer. He says, come and see. Well, I'm staying over here and gives him the address. And I says, come and see. We will never know who Jesus really is by second-hand information, by learning about. You know, there's a lot we can learn about through history, through science, through knowledge alone. But if we only know who Jesus is in the same way that we know, say who Julius Caesar is or who George Washington is, that is in history. Then we only know Jesus as a historical figure. Jesus is a historical figure. There are certain things that can be known about Jesus as a historical figure. We talk about the historical Jesus that's learning about. It's not. It gives us context, there's some value in that. But that is not the same thing as knowing Jesus. That is not the same thing as knowing the word, the logos of God, who became flesh and dwelt among us. So we must come to Jesus by faith and see him in our own experience. Come and see. We come to Jesus by faith, and then we begin to see him in our own experience. But faith comes before experience. That will offend the man of the empiricist mind. So be it. I don't have any solution. You're going to have to come to him by faith because something within you impels you to do so. You come to him by faith and then you begin to see an experience Christ for yourself. They came and saw where Jesus was staying and they remained with him for the rest of the day. It was about four o'clock in the afternoon. Do you know what the commentators say that four o'clock in the afternoon represents? Do you know what the commentators say? I read them all. I've got stacks and stacks and stacks. Ancient and contemporary commentators. Do you know what they say? Four o'clock in the afternoon represents. They don't know. They don't know. Maybe it's because it doesn't symbolize anything. Maybe it was just four o'clock in the afternoon and John never forgot it. It was about four o'clock in the afternoon. Well four o'clock in the afternoon is just four o'clock in the afternoon unless you encounter Jesus in some new and unexpected way. When that happens, that four o'clock in the afternoon will change your life. Divine encounters are real. That is a direct encounter with the living God. Divine encounters are real. And though they cannot be scheduled or manufactured, they should be expected. These divine encounters are mystical experiences by mystical, which is mean a direct experience with the ultimate transcendence who is the living God. These divine encounters and mystical experiences need not occur at some sacred time or in some especially spiritual place. They can occur in the most ordinary places at the most ordinary hour like four o'clock in the afternoon. I suppose the first thing that impelled these two disciples to follow Jesus was curiosity. They didn't know what they were getting themselves into but they were curious. Curiosity can be a kind of saving grace to prevent stalled spiritual development. I'll give that to you again. Probably should have had a slide for that one but didn't feel up to it. Curiosity can be a kind of saving grace to prevent stalled spiritual development. They could have said, John and Andrew, they could have said, well we're with the Baptist and he's the biggest thing right now so we'll just stick with him. But they didn't. They started following Jesus. Something sparked a curiosity about Jesus and they followed that curiosity. I'm sure glad that throughout life I have remained spiritually curious. Not seeking novelty, don't mean that. Rather not staying stuck in settled certitude. I got my doctor and I got my dog my got my statement of faith. I got it 50 years ago. That's good enough. No, it's not. The first thing that impelled them to leave the Baptist and follow Jesus was a holy curiosity. And at four o'clock in the afternoon, John remembers they sat with Jesus in a house. They sat with Jesus in a house at four o'clock in the afternoon. This is the logos, the creator of the universe, their creator, and they're just sitting with him in a house. They don't know all of this yet. They know he's something special but they can't yet understand. They'll get there. They are sitting in a house at four o'clock in the afternoon with the creator of the cosmos. About four o'clock in the afternoon. What did they talk about? John Andrew and the logos creator of the cosmos. What did they talk about? We don't know. Did they share a meal together? Probably. Probably. You know, some of the most important life-changing moments can happen over a meal. Right, Charlie and Ruth? It's really true. Some of the most life-changing moments can happen over a shared meal. I mean, with the right person at the right time, at the right place, something about a meal, it sort of... It takes the pressure off of it. We must have a conversation. It becomes more relaxed. It becomes natural. Right person, right time, right place, conversation over a meal can be life-changing. I know I've had that experience numerous times throughout my life. I think of one. Perry will remember this more than 30 years ago. Remember when we had lunch and Tulsa with Bob Harrison? He didn't give us the answer but he helped us. At the center of our sacramental life is a meal. At least in the form of a ritual recalling a real meal. Sacrament of material means by which we participate in heavenly realities, then becomes regularly presented in the form of ritual. There isn't all in this table, lamb, bitter herbs, unleavened bread, whatever else they have. The four glasses of wine that they were expected to drink at the Paschal Meal, that might make communion a little bit more wild, I don't know. So it's been now presented to us in the form of ritual and that's fine. That's how that works. But it is recalling a real meal. It's calling to us a memory of 2000 years ago when Jesus in the upper room had the last supper with the disciples and took bread and blessed it and broken, gave it, and said, this is my body which is broken for you. And then he took the cup and he blessed it. And he said, this is the blood of the new covenant which is shed for many. And it's recalling through ritual that real meal from 2000 years ago. Everything that followed in John's life, his gospel, his epistles, his apostleship was an aftershock from his original four in the clock afternoon encounter with Jesus. Everything came from that. So stay open to these divine encounters and the possibility of a mystical experience. And I don't want to come across as a scold. I'm going to be a pastor, not a scold, but don't let pervasive technology steal all your four clock in the afternoon possibilities. I know we got our phones. I got mine. It's right here with me. I mean, we've harnessed fire. We've invented the wheel. We have our phones. It's part of our life. It's who we are. But don't spend all of your time with your face in the screen because there's no four clock in the afternoons there. There's information. There's all kinds of stuff, but there's not that. That's found maybe in a conversation over a meal, maybe in a long walk, maybe in a time of prayer. But it's found when you're present to something other than that sort of technology. I can say that everything that happened in my life of ministry is an aftershock from an encounter more than 50 years ago. Don't need to talk about it. I've talked about it so many times. Really, it was two encounters about three hours apart. One somewhere around 9 p.m. Missouri-Western University and then shortly after midnight, three hours later in my own bedroom as a 15-year-old boy. Everything in my life of ministry is a result of that. Everything is just an aftershock from that. I like to walk on the parkways here in St. Joseph. It's one of the great things about this city is the parkway system. I have a particular route that I like to walk. It's exactly six miles. Perry can't believe that I just do the same one over and over and over. It's different people here. It's exactly six miles. I have this particular route that I walk. I like to do it several times a week. I usually am listening to an audiobook. I'll have my ear buds in. I was out there last Wednesday, walk it on the parkway, got my ear buds in. I'm listening to Dostoevsky's demons because right now I have to. About two miles in, I come upon an old man ahead of me walking with a cane. He's walking with a cane and I'm going to pass him. He's walking slow. I'm walking fast. As I walk by him, he looks at me and indicates he wants to say something. Now you need to know this about me. I'm not the most sociable person. I'm not here to have conversations. I'm here to put in my six miles. Get a little Dostoevsky. That's what I'm doing. I could have pretended that I missed his little signal, but I didn't. I say I could have because I don't want you to think I'm better than I am, but in this moment, I didn't. So I stopped and I took out my ear buds and he said, are you a minister? I said, yes, I am. Then he said, at word of life, yes. Then he began to tell me how his father had been a pastor here in St. Joseph for decades. He told me his name and I remembered him from a long time ago. And then he told me he said, after he retired, he liked to listen to your sermons, which surprised me. It made me happy, but very much surprised me. Then this man asked if we could walk together. And I said, okay. He told me he had a stroke a while back. So he had to walk slow and with a cane. We walked together for maybe a half a mile and then he wanted to sit on a bench. So he sat on the bench. He told me that he was writing a book about a mystical experience that he had had when he was 19. So I would say he's writing a book about a mystical experience that probably happened something like 60 years ago. I kind of wonder. I imagine John when he meets Jesus at four o'clock in the afternoon, I think he was about 19. He got around to writing his gospel when he was about 80. Well, this man on the parkway, he told me that in his mystical experience when he was 19, he sensed the union we have with God and with all things, the union that we have with our creator in him, we live and move and have our being and with one another. That yes, we have our individuality, but we're all connected to each other. We're all responsible for one another. There is no them. There's only us. And we're connected and we're together. Doe Staevsky talks about this all the time. In fact, he was talking about it in the part of the book that I was listening to. And it shows up in many of his books, Crime and Punishment, Brothers, Kare Monsop. This, he presents it in the form of a mystical experience where you suddenly realize we're all part of this together. We're all responsible for one another. We can't break off into our own individualized, atomized existence. We have to acknowledge that we belong to our creator, we belong to one another and we're responsible for one another. Well, I've read enough books on mystical experiences to know that this is probably the most common experience, sensation, revelation of a mystical experience. So he was telling me something that has really been confirmed that this is very common. It was four o'clock in the afternoon. I mean, it was four o'clock in the afternoon when we had our conversation. But this was his four o'clock in the afternoon experience from 60 years earlier. An experience he was writing about from an experience 60 years earlier. I suppose it's his version of the Gospel of John. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, when you say to us, what are you seeking? We respond by saying, where are you staying? What are you doing? Where can we find you? How can we be with you? We're not seeking for you to do something for us. We are seeking for you to be with us. And then we hear you say, Lord Jesus, come and see. Yes, that's what we want. We want to have our own four o'clock in the afternoon experience with you. We want to come by faith and see an experience you who are the eternal logos, our creator, the word made flesh. Amen. Stand up with me. And let's begin to come to this meal in the form of ritual that recalls a real meal two thousand years ago that we are invited today to participate in. Let's begin first by confessing together our faith. I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth. I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord. He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended to the dead. On the third day, he rose again. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen. Now join with me in together confessing our sins. Most merciful God, we confess that we have sinned against you in thought, word, and deed. By what we have done and by what we have left undone, we have not loved you with our whole heart. We have not loved our neighbors as ourselves. We are truly sorry and we humbly repent. For the sake of your Son, Jesus Christ, have mercy on us and forgive us, that we may delight in your will and walk in your ways to the glory of your name. Amen. And God is gracious to all who confess their sins and in humility, ask for mercy. In the name of Jesus Christ, your sins are forgiven. And this is the table, not of the church, but of the Lord. It is made ready for those who love Him and for those who want to love Him more. So come, you who have much faith and you who have little. You who have been here often and you who have not been here long. You who have tried to follow and you who have failed come because it is the Lord who invites you. It is His will that those who want Him should meet Him here. The body of Christ broken for you, the blood of Christ shed for you. Amen."

I'm glad you're interested in what we have to say as we try to serve the Lord Jesus Christ. And if you would ever be so inclined to help us financially, you can do that at wolc.com. All right, good morning everybody. You brave souls here in the house of the Lord and the rest of you all cozy and snug at home. Yeah, it's a good day to be in the house of the Lord in person online. Welcome. Before I turn to the gospel passage for this Sunday, I want to begin by going to the original source for it in Isaiah. We've been having a grand time with Isaiah over the last few months. Isaiah, chapter 9. But there will be no more gloom for those who were in anguish. In the former time, he brought in to contempt the land of Zebulan and the land of Nathtali. But in the latter time, he will make glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles. The people who have walked in darkness have seen a great light. Those who dwell in the land of deep darkness on them light has shined. A prophecy about the land of Zebulan and Nathtali. Of course Zebulan and Nathtali are two of the tribes of Israel. There are a lot meant in the promised land. It was on the west side of the Sea of Galilee. Zebulan, Nathtali. This was the land where you will find Mount Teibor. It's the land where you will find towns like Maghiro, Nazareth, Bethseda, Capernum. But here Isaiah describes it as a land in anguish. A land brought into contempt, a land of deep darkness. You see, the land of Israel happens to be situated in a corridor between the great northern empires of the Hittites, the Assyrians, the Babylonians in the north. And then in the south, the great empire of Egypt. And you know what empires do, don't you? They go to war with one another because everybody wants to be the big dog. Problem for Israel was they're called in between. And so very frequently the land of Israel in general, the land of Zebulan and Nathtali would turn into a battlefield, especially there in the Jezreal Valley in the land of Zebulan and Nathtali, the Jezreal Valley. That's where the town of Maghiro is. Today we call it Tel Maghiro, a Tel. If you go there, you see a small mountain in the midst of the valley, except it's not a natural mountain. That town has been destroyed and rebuilt 24 times. Destroyed rebuilt, destroyed, until building upon the previous rubble, it turns into Tel Maghiro or Har Maghiro for the Hebrew Mount Maghiro or Armageddon. That's where that comes from. And so it's a land though beautiful, has been subject to so many wars and battles and conflicts. It's in anguish, it's held in contempt, it's a land of deep darkness. Isaiah here prophesies that in the latter time this contemptible land in deep darkness, in Galilee of the Gentiles, in that place a great light will begin to shine, that will change everything. A land of anguish and contempt will achieve a glorious fame because of this light. And then Isaiah tells us why this light is going to shine for unto us, child is born. unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, mighty God, everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of course just like the first Christians, we hear this ancient prophecy from the sixth century before Christ and we go, oh that's Jesus. Amen and amen. Let's just sit with an amen. His name will be called Wonderful Counselor. When Jesus comes what's he doing? He is teaching and preaching and proclaiming the kingdom of God. God's alternative society, the empires of the world form this world one way and Jesus comes and says let me give you some wonderful counsel. There's a better way. Next Sunday our gospel reading is the Beatitudes. Blessed are the poor and spirit. For theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn. For they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek. For they shall inherit their principalities and powers, the empires. They don't believe that. They believe it's a strong that take what they want. The strong do what they will and the weak must suffer what they must. Jesus says no, no, no, no, no. Blessed are the meek. He'll inherit the earth. He's the wonderful counselor that gives us a different way to live. It will only listen to his wonderful counsel and follow him. Wonderful counselor, mighty God. Mighty God. I mean what a title, mighty God. Because he is true God from true God. He's God. And I never tire of saying this. The value of confessing the deity of Christ is that at last we know what God is like. Because we don't know what God is like apart from Christ. What we usually end up with as our idea of God is our anxieties and ambitions deified. We take our greatest fears and we make them God-like. We take our greatest desires and ambitions and make them God-like. We say that's God. It's idolatry is what it is. It's not until the word becomes flesh that we know what mighty God is like. He's like Jesus God. I never get tired of saying God is like Jesus. God has always been like Jesus. There's never been a time God wasn't like Jesus. We haven't always known this, but now we do because of this child that's born unto us, the Son that's given to us, that is mighty God. God is like Jesus. Wonderful counselor, mighty God. Everlasting Father? Well yes, because Jesus is the new Adam, the last Adam. In Adam all die, but in Christ also live. We have a new progenitor. We have a new way of being human in Christ. Christ has died, Christ has risen and we are baptized into Christ. And he is the new Adam, the new race that teaches us finally how to be human. We have a new way of being human in Christ. Wonderful counselor, mighty God. Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Or is over if you want it. Put up your sword, Jesus says. Put that away, Peter. You live by it, you die by it. Better yet, turn it into a plough share. And the government shall be upon his shoulder. What does that mean? The government shall be upon his shoulder. Sometimes as they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. The government shall be upon his shoulder. You know what that is? That's the government of Rome. It's the government of Rome. All they have their senator, they have their emperor. But really how they rule is we have the most power to kill. And if you rebel, you get out of line, we will take our government and put you to death upon it. And Jesus comes and takes that government and puts it upon his shoulder, carries it to Calvary, dies upon the cross, descends to the dead, is raised on a third day and transforms the cross into something altogether different. Indeed this now becomes the government of God. The governments of the empires of this world, they are an axis of power enforced by violence. But Christ takes that, axis of power enforced by violence and transforms it into an axis of love expressed in forgiveness. The government of God, which is just another way of saying the kingdom of God, always is cruciform. It always looks like that. But it doesn't look like that, it's not the kingdom of God. The government shall be upon his shoulder. Isaiah foresees these things and a glass darkly went in the latter time. A light was shining in Galilee. Now we go to the gospel. Now we go to the gospel. Matthew chapter four. Now when Jesus heard that John had been arrested, I think I have to stop there for a second. When Jesus heard that John the Baptist was arrested, the gospel is political because it is always a challenge to the principalities and powers. Jesus said, from the days of John the Baptist, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence and violent men attack it. The arrival of the kingdom of God is not good news for everybody. The principalities and powers will hate it and fight it. Jesus says, from the days of John the Baptist, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence and violent men attack it. And so it goes. From John the Baptist to Justin Martyr to Deedrick Bonhoeffer, there always will be, always has been those who because of their allegiance to Jesus Christ will be arrested. And some will be made martyrs. Now when Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew to Galilee. He left Nazareth and made his home in cappernum by the sea in the territory of Zebulon, a Naf-Tali, so that what had been spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled in the land of Zebulon, in the land of Naf-Tali, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles, the people who sat in darkness have seen a great light. And those who sat in the region and shadow of death upon them, light has dawned. Now we understand Isaiah's then mysterious prophecy from the sixth century BC. This is the light that dawns in the shadow of death and shines in Galilee. Understand that almost all of Jesus' ministry happens in Galilee. He goes to Jerusalem a few times. Of course that's where he is crucified and where he is raised from the dead. But the vast majority, almost all of his teachings, preaching, miracles, healings occur in the land of Zebulon, Naf-Tali, in Galilee of the Gentiles. This light that dawns in the shadow of death and shines in Galilee, this light is not an idea. It's not a philosophy. It is a person, Jesus of Nazareth. The light is a person. Someone asked me beginning of the year, do you have a theme, a word or a theme for 2026? And I was ready to say, no, I don't. I said, I was forming the sentence in my mind. I don't really do that anymore. This is not, I don't do that. I started to say that when unbidden, a word leapt into my mind and shouted, light. I thought, well, I guess I do. I didn't know I had a word in the theme for 2026, but I found out I did. Because when I started to say, no, what came out was light. Light. In 2026, I want to live in the light and I want to bring the light. Jesus is a light in dark places. Phew, that's good. Now, a light in dark places doesn't always immediately change the dark places. Hear me. Jesus is a light in dark places. But a light in dark places doesn't always immediately change the dark places. Galilee under brutal Roman occupation remained Galilee under brutal Roman occupation. That didn't change because of Jesus. What changed was in that land of darkness and oppression, anguish, Isaiah says, a light is shining. And now it's going to be famous for that. A light shining in a dark place does not always immediately change the dark place, but a light in a dark place makes all the difference. I mean, the place you may still be surrounded by darkness, but if you've got light, that makes all the difference. You can hold on. You can do it. If you're in the darkness and there's nothing much darkness, you might despair, but if you've got a light, you can hold the hope. A light in dark places. That's my sermon title. Some of you may recognize that as a line from Lord of the Rings. Why not? It comes from the end of the first volume, the fellowship of the ring. When the fellowship are in Lothelorean with Galadriel, the mightiest and fairest of all the elves Tolkien tells us. Galadriel, Lady of the Wood. And as the fellowship is beginning to depart the haven of Lothelorean to go on their quest, Galadriel gives gifts to the members of the fellowship. And she saves her best gift for last and gives it to Frodo, the ring bearer. She says to Frodo, in this file is called the Light of Aaron Dill's Star. It will shine still brighter when night is about you. May it be to you a light in dark places when all other lights go out. Now this gift helped Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamji more than once. But then there is another passage related to this theme of light in dark places that occurs in the third volume, return of the King. Now Frodo and Sam are in the depths of Mordor. When it seems like the shadow is winning and their task is impossible and all hope is fading. Frodo is sleeping from exhaustion. But Sam is awake and he gazes into the night sky and he saw a single twinkling white star, the star of Aaron Dill. Galadriel had given to Frodo a vile that captured some of the light of that star. And that was a light that could shine in dark places. But now in the depths of Mordor, Sam sees the star itself. He sees the star itself, token writes, the beauty of it smote his heart. As he looked up out of the forsaken land and hoped return to him. For like a shaft clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the shadow was only a small and passing thing. There was light and high beauty forever beyond its reach. I love that. It's many people's favorite passage in the entire Lord of the Rings. He saw that light. And he thought, oh wait a minute, give me some perspective here. After all the shadow is only what does he say, a small and passing thing. Guess it's real that's here, it's now, but it's a small and passing thing. There is light and beauty forever beyond its reach. Well what token says in fantasy, John the Elder says in Scripture. The darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining. Come on now. Do you believe that? Is that real to you? Christ has died, Christ has risen, Christ will come again. The darkness is passing away. The true light, the true light is already shining. Began to shine in Galilee. We thought that it was extinguished at Galgata, but no, Easter came. And that light just continues to shine and to shine and to shine and to shine. Christ has died, Christ has risen, Christ will come again. The darkness is passing away, the true light is already shining. And what Tolkien calls Aaron Dill's stars, what we call the morning star, that's what it is, Venus, the morning star. And we find the morning star in Scripture. And so we have the prophetic message confirmed. And you will do well to pay attention to it as to a light shining in a dark place until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. So we have a prophetic message. It's been confirmed. We're to pay attention to it. What is this prophetic word? This prophetic message? Well, the text tells us. The prophetic word is what Peter heard on the Holy Mountain. On Mount Teybor. In the land of Zebulon and Nath Tali. This is my beloved son. With whom I'm well pleased. That's the prophetic word. The prophetic word is the voice of God saying to Jesus of Nazareth, this is my beloved son. With whom I'm well pleased. The prophetic message for you to hold on to. It's about who Jesus is. He's not just a good teacher. He's that, but he's not just that. He's not merely a dispenser of perennial wisdom. He can't reduce him to just some sort of reformer of the Jewish religion. In the first century. No, no, no. This is the Son of God. This is the Savior of the world. Now, if you can believe that Jesus is the Son of God and pay attention to that word. Because there's a lot of clamors for your attention. A lot of shouting at us. 24-7. If you can believe that Jesus is not just a good teacher. Not just some reforming Jew who lived and died 2000 years ago. You can believe the prophetic message that this is the Son of God, the Savior of the world. If you can believe that and pay attention to it, something will happen. Not around you, but inside of you. Not around you, but inside you. If you could say, I believe that Jesus is the Son of God, the Savior of the world. Something begins to happen inside of you. Despite the darkness all around you, a light begins to dawn inside of you. And Jesus has the morning star arises in your heart. The file of Gladreel. It's given to Frodo. I just... The file of the Holy Spirit. Given to us as a light and dark places. And then sometimes we see the light itself. We see Jesus. And we say, this shadow is a passing thing. It's a small and passing thing. There's light and beauty that's far beyond its reach. And so we hold on to that. I'm a guest on about 60 to 70 podcasts a year. There's a lot of podcasts out there. There's a lot of podcasts out there. And my goal is to be on all of my guests. And so, you know, I'm pretty used to how they work. And they're all kind of alike. I mean, some of them are different, but most of them sort of follow the pattern. And one of the most common questions at the end of the interview. I get this all the time. They'll be asked, what gives you hope these days? It's a very common closing question. What gives you hope these days? And they used to think, you know, I need to come up with something clever. Something pitty. Something that is very prescient. People go, oh, yeah, wow. Like, I need to have, I need to identify some trend. Some anecdote. Some sign within society that gives me hope. And then I decided that's nonsense. I might as well just tell them the truth. Even if it sounds like I'm being all super-spirits or whatever. We're coming to the end of the podcast now. I have one final question for you. I'm like, I know what it is. What gives you hope these days? Jesus. Jesus. I mean, I don't know what else to say. It's not some trend. It's not some anecdote. It's not something I've observed. It's the morning star that is Christ rising in my heart. The Christ has died. Christ has risen. Christ will come again. The shadow of evil is only a passing thing. The good is always there. The evil is just trying to be there. Hold on to that. The good is always there. The evil is just trying to be there. The darkness has passed it away in the true light. It's already shining. The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light. And upon those who sat in the region and shadow of death, light has dawned. And then Him was life. And then Him was life. And the life was the light of all people. And the light shines in the darkness. And the darkness did not and cannot overcome it. Pay attention to the light. Believe in the light. Live in the light. And bring the light. Amen. Amen. Stand up with me. And now, let's come to this table. And participate in the life. The life was the light. And the life has also given to us in the sacrament of Holy Communion. First of all, let's confess our Christian faith together. I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth. I believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord. He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried. He descended to the dead. On the third day, He rose again. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body and the life everlasting. Amen. Now join with me in together confessing our sins. Most merciful God, we confess that we have sinned against you in thought, word, and deed. By what we have done and by what we have left undone, we have not loved you with our whole heart. We have not loved our neighbors as ourselves. We are truly sorry and we humbly repent. For the sake of your Son, Jesus Christ, have mercy on us and forgive us. That we may delight in your will and walk in your ways to the glory of your name, amen. And God is gracious to all who confess their sins. Amen humility, ask for mercy. In the name of Jesus Christ, your sins are forgiven. And this is the table, not of the church, but of the Lord. It is made ready for those who love Him and for those who want to love Him more. So come, you who have much faith and you who have little. You who have been here often and you who have not been here long. You who have tried to follow and you who have failed come because it is the Lord who invites you. It is His will that those who want Him should meet Him here. The body of Christ broken for you, the blood of Christ shed for you, amen."

88,68b4f06919a992b0,12040,61444,en,whisper_local,base,v1.0,"2026-02-18 12:31:21","All right, we're going to take Daniel chapter one today and we did an overview last time, kind of an introduction to the book and the structure and the outline and the three different sieges in Jerusalem and what Nebuchadnezzar was trying to accomplish and what really the Lord was using Nebuchadnezzar four as his instrument of judgment upon Israel and these three sieges. And so we'll dive into the book today in chapter one where Daniel and his three friends are taken captive and drug off to Babylon in this first siege. So there's a there are a lot of great lessons here in Daniel one about just simply refusing the world and I just want you to get the picture of Daniel as this young Jewish man who has grown up in Israel but is captive by a foreign enemy drug off to a land that he's never been to they speak a language he doesn't know they're eating food that he's not familiar with he's captive in this prison and he has every reason to accept what the king is trying to give him and he denies it because it goes against what God wants him to do and so we're going to learn a lot about this or through this event and I hope it's encouraging to you on refusing what the enemy would ask would offer you out of this world in our lives today because it's very applicable so let's pray Father I thank you so much for this time together and God I just pray that you would bless our study in your word this morning as we go through Daniel chapter one. God I thank you for preserving this book for us Lord as you told Daniel in chapter 12 to seal up the book until the time of the end and Father we're here we've we have made it to this point we're all the way thousands of years in the future in 2026 and Lord this book is every bit as applicable and exciting to study today as it was when you wrote it through Daniel all those centuries ago and so Father I just pray that these lessons would not be wasted on us that God you would use them to build up our most holy faith on your word Lord because of Romans 10 17 faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God and Lord we need to build up our faith on your word today more than ever to stand against what the enemy is trying to push into this earth at this time and Father I just pray that you'd use this this book of prophecy to teach us to give us eyes to see and ears to hear what your spirit is doing in this world today and Father we thank you for it and your precious name we pray Jesus amen amen okay so we've got to we've got to lean on the Holy Spirit so that out of first on 227 28 if you have the Holy Spirit the annoying that that abides in you teach you everything out of the word of God then we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming as it says in verse 28 so the way you have confidence and to stand unashamed before Christ is to build your life on the word of God and only the word of God there is there is no faith in anything else and if you'll just listen to what God says not what other people say says and not what you hope he says because it fits some narrative you've built in your head then then you will be a refined vessel fit for service that will not be ashamed when Christ calls us home in the rapture or when you take your last breath whichever comes first and that's actually a part of the mission statement that the Lord wrote for this church is to foster strengthen and grow an unashamed bride for Jesus' return and the only way to do that is to get the word of God back into the body of Christ so that we are on the meat of the word growing according to what God wants us to have in a study and not anything else if there's anything in my lifetime for sure that the church has been lacking in almost every church I've been a part of my whole life it's simply just studying the Bible and it's really heartbreaking because it's the one thing and the one most important thing that we should build our lives on as Christians because in the beginning was the word and Jesus is the word the word became flesh and tabernacle amongst us according to John 114 so we should be studying it and how often according to act 1711 we should be studying it daily so it's a daily routine you've got to wash your mind with the regenerative water of the word daily and take it in daily and build up your life so that you can stand against whatever this world is throwing at you and you see things I mean just think about where we were six years ago this month kind of hearing about something going on in China with some coronavirus and and then all of a sudden the world got shut down in March of 2020 and a lot of Christians around the world I'm not saying any way specifically here in Oklahoma City but just a lot of Christians around the world fear and panic took over their life and it should have never done that if you if you would have been in the Bible studying the Bible and building up your faith then you can stand when the enemy throws things like that at us in the world at the church so no other book of the Bible really has been challenged more and yet proven more than Daniel people have spent thousands of years trying to disprove the book of Daniel and many of them actually come to know Christ as a result because it's such a prophetic book and it it is a proof text to the the one thing that the Holy Spirit the one attribute the Holy Spirit has that no other book ever written on earth has which is it can predict the future with 100% accuracy and prophetically and it's important so Daniel he's the dearly beloved prophet and he's personally tried and tested by two world empires so we're going to see him start to be tested by Babylon today here in chapter 1 but he will he is a model for us today on how to live in and confront a world that's against our faith and our God and that's important and it's important because the world's going to try to tempt you and throw you off with a lot of things they're going to throw everything they can at you to get you distracted Satan wants you looking left and right not straight ahead at what God wants of you so the book chronicles some of the most miraculous prophecies in the entire Bible some of these prophecies we're going to study as we go through this they are so detailed with dates and timelines that come to pass exactly as God laid out it's just incredible you I don't know how anyone can study this and still be an atheist I have no idea but people do and it's just it's heartbreaking but it's one of the few occasions the in the Old Testament too that God looks at the world through a Gentile lens so most of the book focuses on these Gentile nations that rule the earth starting from Babylon all the way down to the anti-Christ kingdom and it's an interesting it's an interesting thing that God does because most of the Old Testament focuses through Israel obviously the peculiar people that God called out for his name and this book though focuses on the world through the Gentile world powers so in 332 BC Alexander the Great conquered Jerusalem this was you know long after Daniel and Persia was over and and got conquered but he conquered Jerusalem and the priest actually showed him references to himself in the book of Daniel and as a result the entire city was spared and Josephus wrote about that in the very very early days before Jesus Josephus wrote about that now from 1899 to 1917 excavations of Nebuchadnezzar's palace took place surrounding the Babylonian city and the surrounding Babylonian city and the banquet hall from the Daniel 5 the handwriting on the wall event it's found to be 173 feet by 56 feet in size so just to give you an idea of the scale and the grandeur of the kingdom of Babylon that was just their banquet hall and it was actually rebuilt by Saddam Hussein during the Gulf War time before the Gulf War I should say before he was taken out but he had this whole mission Saddam Hussein had a belief that he would be the second coming of Nebuchadnezzar and he was trying to rebuild Babylon in Iraq on the banks of Euphrates now that's going to be very important as we get into the destruction of Babylon versus the fall of Babylon when Persia comes in and takes over Babylon without a fight they come in under the cover of dark Cyrus the Persian takes over Babylon and many of the civilians for three days don't even know that they've been conquered by Persia and it's a very important distinction because because God prophesies at some point the destruction of Babylon and a lot of people think that happened when Cyrus took over but if again if you just take God at his word one of his prophecies is that it will the city will never be rebuilt again and the building blocks will never be used again well when Saddam Hussein built was rebuilding Nebuchadnezzar's palace you can find this video out on National Geographic but they're doing a tour of the site and the guys walking through I'll never forget the guys walking through it there's this huge wall in Babylon and there's these clay bricks they were building that Saddam Hussein was making to build and they have those little inscriptions on them with the oh the like an Egypt the different animals and things and the guys walking out with the camera crew and there's one brick kind of towards the bottom of the wall that's a completely different color that just stood out and the one guy goes the tour guide stops and goes hey hey come here come here this brick this is one of Nebuchadnezzar's original bricks from his palace that Saddam Hussein used and I just thought that was so fascinating because God says in Isaiah 13 to 14 in Jeremiah 1551 in Revelation 17 and 18 that the original bricks would never be reused and you had this video proof in modern times of it being used and so the destruction of Babylon it's never occurred as God says it and that's just one detail but he also says it'd be destroyed in an instant like Saddam and Gomorrah their people would never live there again and there's people there living there today and so there's a lot of details you can look at to say okay this is something in the future that hasn't happened yet but we're going to get there it's really an interesting study so Jesus validates Daniel as a prophet in Matthew 24 15 and Mark 13 14 and in Matthew 24 just to give you a quick side note of that Matthew 24 Jesus is speaking to the Jewish people on how to survive during the tribulation it's not written it's not a discourse to the church it's to the Jews that's why he says pray that your flight be not in winter or on the Sabbath day so he's speaking to the Jews when you see the abomination of Daniel of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet standing the holy place he's talking about the the temple that's yet to be built so this temple that the temple institutes trying to build right now that's what Jesus is prophesying back in Matthew 24 verse 15 so Daniel prophesies the abomination of desolation it's a technical term in the Bible of when the anti-Christ will come into the holy of holies and declare himself to be God and it's that point that marks the midpoint of the tribulation and from that point to the end of the tribulation is what Jesus declared to be the great tribulation okay he says that would be a time of trouble unlike the world has ever seen or we'll see again so when you're talking about the seven-year tribulation you've got to kind of distinguish the great tribulation is the back half technically the whole time is awful of course but the back half specifically Jesus says is even worse than the front half in any case so that's when you see that in Matthew 24 that's what he's talking about and he's also giving you a hint of technology in the future because the holy of holies when Jesus says this in Matthew 24 you know how if you were a a Jewish person in somewhere else outside of Jerusalem and outside the city in the hill country how would you see the abomination of desolation take place well because it's inside the temple inside the holy of holies and you wouldn't be able to see it necessarily but now we know in the tribulation when the anti-Christ does this and declares himself to be God it will be global news it'll be a world on world scale and everyone on earth has a phone in their pocket they're going to be watching this happen and so literally Jesus meant that when you see it happen so there's technology statements like that throughout the Bible which are really fascinating but Daniel's also the only prophet in the Old Testament who's noted to be greatly the loved okay obviously God loves everyone but he has a special affection for Daniel because there's nothing bad said about and the Holy Spirit writes it that way intentionally to bring your attention to here's a man that walked humbly before God never back down off God's word stood for what God called them to do living in a hostile hostile world he went from the prison cell to the palace back to the prison cell to the lions den back to the palace he lived a very emotionally probably unstable life I'm sure he's probably all these highs and lows and but he stayed stable on God's word and because of that there's nothing bad said about him which I think is really fascinating even Abraham didn't have that distinction and first in Isaiah 488 and second Chronicles 20 verse 7 God calls Abraham his friend so he's using a different term for him versus Daniel and Daniel's the one who then gets the most revelation so to speak of the end times and what's going on in Bible prophecy so it's a note John is the only one that gets that in the New Testament and he gets given the book of Revelation just as a side note so you see that pattern hold true um Aaron can you go the next slide please okay the three times God declares that it's in Daniel 923 Daniel 1011 and Daniel 1019 so just for reference God God means that he uses that pretty consistently of Daniel so he's also spoken of three times in Ezekiel so Ezekiel 1414 1420 and 28 verse 3 and God is using this as that if he's declared destruction of Jerusalem and that the Israel is going to be hauled away to babble on here remember Jeremiah Ezekiel and Daniel are all kind of around the same time together they all overlap and so he's using Noah Daniel and Job as an example of hey I wouldn't even spare the city if these three guys lived there their righteousness wouldn't be enough to spare the city and so that's pretty that's pretty neat God has that view of Daniel even when Ezekiel's alive and Daniel's alive in the same day and I think that's really really amazing Joseph is another example of a man of God who nothing bad is said about him in the scripture and you can't say that about many people in the Bible God has a rebuke or something for a lot of people in the Bible even David you know who messed up a lot so the outline of the book chapters one through six are historical chapters with some visions so you have chapter one today is what we're taking the Jewish captives taken to babble on next time a nebuchadnezzar's dream it lays out the future of the anti-Christ kingdom and what that's about the Fari furnace in chapter three nebuchadnezzar's pride he writes as a Gentile king chapter four of the book of Daniel it's the only chapter in the entire Old Testament written by a Gentile king and not someone from the Jewish family somewhere the follow babble on takes place in chapter five and that's what the handwriting on the wall many many Teclah Eufarson and they could interpret it but Daniel could then there's the lines then after Persia and then chapter seven Daniel gets the vision of the four beasts so seven through twelve are prophetic chapters with a little bit of history then there's the ram and the hego at the 70 weeks prophecy in chapter nine which is incredible there's a view into the dark side behind these world powers in chapter 10 remember Daniel sets out to fast for twenty what twenty one days and it took that entire fast for the angel to get a message to Daniel and there's a lot to learn in that because prayer and fasting has a big impact on the spiritual side of what you cannot see right now God wants you to be a prayer warrior and and fasting is very powerful in the spirit so there's a silent year supposedly in chapter 11 God details in advance what happens there for those 430 years from the close of the Old Testament and Malachi until Matthew chapter one and then the consummation of all things in the end time so chapter 12 so that kind of gives you an overview of the book if you remember the chapters are not written chronological orders so that's kind of important as we go through these just keep in mind we'll highlight that as we go but the first four are in order and then it kind of changes a little bit so it's four and then five and six are later on and chapter seven is the vision of the four beasts really is what happens next in the chronology so just keep that in mind as you're reading through it now we talked about the Siege's last time in my very generic excel sheet all of you can make fun of me it's fine that's at least color coded so so you have the first second and third siege so nebuchadnezzar besiege Jerusalem three times the first siege is when Daniel's taken and then Ezekiel remember is taken later but he's taken it over by the river Chibar and he works the fields Daniel of the princely royal line is taken to the palace because nebuchadnezzar wanted the best of the best and you have these these three sieges and then the decree of Cyrus is really that decree starts the Persian Empire and starts the 70 weeks of Daniel the do or I'm sorry the decree of art is orcs he starts that the decree of art is orcs he starts the 70 weeks of Daniel the decree of Cyrus is what starts the Persian Empire but the servitude of the nation and you can kind of see the yellow the servitude and then the desolations of Jerusalem for those 70 years not to be confused with the 70 weeks of Daniel so there's a lot of 70s in Daniel you got to keep those straight there's 70 years there in Babylon but then there's 70 weeks of years or 490 years that Daniel's given a prophecy for in Daniel chapter 9 which will be giving us to the day that Jesus rides in on the donkey in the in the New Testament okay in chapter one here in the third year of the reign of Jehaya Kim King of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon unto Jerusalem and besieged it so sieging a city was the worst thing that could happen to wherever you lived in ancient times so if your city was besieged it was awful you were starved to death you couldn't go out and get you know fresh water unless you had a well within the city you couldn't get any supplies inner inner out of the city for food it was terrible it was absolutely one of the worst things that could happen to a city now Nebuchadnezzar uses this constantly just to punish whatever nation he's trying to take over that was one of his tactics so he he besieges Jerusalem and the Lord gave Jehaya Kim King of Judah into his hand with part of the vessels of the house of God which he carried into the land of Shainar to the house of his God so Nebuchadnezzar at this time is bringing these vessels out of God's temple and putting them into a false God's temple in Babylon okay big mistake now Nebuchadnezzar is going we're gonna see as we go on he's going to actually humble himself and give praise to the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and but his grandson in the future uses these in a bad way and he's going to regret that in chapter five and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his God so Shainar okay Genesis 11 verse two look at this and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plane in the land of Shainar and they dwelt theirs now Shainar think of it as kind of the county of where Babylon would reign so we live in Oklahoma County Oklahoma City and Edmund and wherever else are in Oklahoma County but the county would be like Shainar over an Iraq Shainar is the plane or the county Babylon being the city so when Nimrod founds Babylon back in Genesis 10 and 11 and throughout there with the Tower of Babel that's in that plane of Shainar now it's important if you remember our study in Zachariah there's a prophecy of the Harlot B system or the Harlot religion returning to build a land or build a tower in a place for her to dwell on her base in the plane of Shainar and it's important it's a key on why and it might just be speculation but why the Harlot religion that we learn about in Revelation goes back and it has its central point in Babylon again actual physical literal Babylon much like how it began with Nimrod so in Zachariah has that prophecy of a woman that's wicked and in ephod and the storks that are unclean and the Jewish mind carry her back to her own base in Shainar so there's a there's a key there we're going to study later on in Daniel okay and the king spake unto Aspin as the master of his unix that he should bring certain of the children of Israel and out of the king's seed and of the princes okay so this is Nebuchadnezzar's plan right remember he always wants the best of the land of whatever he takes over to try to assimilate into his kingdom so he wants the wealthy educated people to be in his palace while the peasants go off and you know work the fields or whatever they're trying to do now this is part of this is one of the verses that leads us to believe Daniel was of the the royal line and we'll see it again later on that he is of the line of Judah and they okay so this was prophesied back in second kings to Hezekiah now look at second kings 20 14 through 18 then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah and said it to him what said these men and from whence came they unto thee and Hezekiah said they are come from a far country even from Babylon okay now Hezekiah He did a lot of great things for the Lord now this is long before Daniel's time he did a lot of great things for God but he failed in this moment so at this time if you remember in Hezekiah's day they still had the brass serpent Moses built in the wilderness and they were worshiping it and Hezekiah had to destroy it remember he called it a thing of brass and broke it into pieces in Hezekiah's day they had not read the word of God for many many years and he found a copy of it in the destruction somewhere and he read it and they had this huge revival Hezekiah is also the one that remember Isaiah said your days are up here about to go home and he prayed for more time and God gave him a said okay I'll grant your wish gave him 15 more years and if you study those years they were not good for Hezekiah he probably should not have requested more time but God gave him the option do you want this to be proven by the sundial going forward or backward and Hezekiah chose backwards and so God made time go backwards for Hezekiah and he was granted 15 more years and I just think that's fascinating but he messes up here in 2nd Kings 20 so these men from Babylon come and Isaiah the prophet comes to him says hey what have you done what have you shown them and he said what have they seen in 9th house and Hezekiah answered all the things that are in my house have they seen there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them do you hear what he's saying there's nothing among my treasures not gods not gods temple not God's house not God's kingdom that He has built for a place for his people Hezekiah is saying hey this is all my stuff and yeah I showed all of it to the Babylonians and that he messed up there's nothing among my treasure that I've showed them and Isaiah said unto Hezekiah hear the word of the Lord behold the days come that all that is in thine house fine you want it to be your house okay all that's in thine house and that which thy fathers have laid up and store into this day shall be carried into Babylon nothing shall be left say at the Lord and of thy sons shall issue from the which thou shalt begett shall they take away and they shall be unix in the palace of the king of Babylon so he's saying everything you have has a kind which what I have given to Israel is going to be drug off to Babylon and of your royal line your children will be drug off also so Daniel very well may have been from Hezekiah's line the God's word doesn't say but that's interesting okay in verse four here children in whom have was no blemish but well favored and skillful in all wisdom and cunning and knowledge and understanding science and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the caldians so nebuchadnezzar wants people that are highly intelligent cunning and knowledge they're educated they're wealthy they're of the royal line they have understanding of science so what was he wanting scientists for that's kind of interesting he's very known we'll see here in a little while that nebuchadnezzar used a lot of kind of I'll use the phrase black magic but he's tried to use astrologers and sorcerers and wizards and these things that he should not have been trying to practice in his court and he's using them so he's probably looking for people maybe they know something that our guys don't so he wanted the best of the best now back in in verse three the king's seed and the princess so Daniel of the royal line he was deported eight years before Ezekiel so keep that in mind Ezekiel still back in Jerusalem Daniel's now in Babylon Jeremiah is a very old man in Jerusalem at this time telling the king that hey you're you're in for it you need to humble yourself now the king wanted these these people what he believed by taking the best the best is that Babylon would last forever that was kind of his strategy if I took the best from every other nation that we conquer then we'll have kind of the all-star the probole so to speak an our nation will last forever we can outlive these like Egypt and these other nations before us a Syria that have gone astray and gone down in verse five and the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat and of the wine which he drank so nourishing them three years that at the end thereof they might stand before the king so he wanted them to be assimilated into Babylon and his culture for three years before they could ever step foot in the palace to see him that's how long he thought this program would take to get them on their diet to get them on their language to get them to understand their their history books or whatever it is to get them educated in the ways of the Babylonians then they were welcome to come before the king so he was very very patient in this matter that he was setting out to do now among these were of the children of Judah Daniel, Hennoniah, Mishel and Aziraya so remember that's we're going to talk about these guys by their god-given names not the the Babylonian pagan names of Shadrach Mishak and Abindigo but under whom the Prince of the Unix gave names for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belta Shazzar and to Hennoniah of Shadrach and Mishel Mishak and to Aziraya Abindigo okay notice that was the first thing they did so they drug these guys off and what do they do the first thing they do is they try to change their identity of who they are the world will do the same thing to you and I as Christians the role will try to change your identity and try to put a name on you that God does not have for you remember in Revelation 2 and 3 Jesus says I have a new name for you that no one knows and he's got a white stone for you and our in our inheritance and reward study we studied that that Jesus has a new name for you in the millennium that you're going to have for eternity a name that you will last forever and Jesus personally has it for you there's a reward tied to that so God's names look at these Daniel means God is my judge his name from Babylon Belta Shazzar means Prince of Bel okay so they're trying to they're trying to get them off of the godly heritage Hennoniah means beloved of the Lord Shadrach means illuminated by the Sun God so they had all these different gods they worship the Sun God and the moon God and the the little dung beetles and all this weird stuff Michiel who is as God is what his Jewish name means Meschak means who is like unto the moon God so do you see the counterfeit the whole time as Zeraya the Lord is my help a bin Nego means servant of Nego a shining fire now Nego appears to be a variant form of Nego in ancient times it's an ancient God or fallen angel worshiped by Babylon and the name appears in Isaiah 46 verse 1 Bell boweth down Nego stupid their idols were upon the beast and upon the cattle your carriages were heavy laden they are a burden to the to the wary beast now so in that verse in Isaiah 46 one God has the name of Babylon tried to name Daniel after and who he they tried to name as Zeraya after now those false gods these fallen angels or demonic spirits whatever you want to label you want to put on them these unclean gods that are that are pagan that are enemies to the the most high god they will bow down to the name of Jesus at some point when when the scripture says every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus is Lord that he's not just talking about humans he's talking about Satan's going to do that at some point you're going to watch Satan bow down at the feet of Jesus according to Romans and confess that he is God Bell and Nego those those gods those false gods have the same fate waiting for them it's just a matter of between now and then you and I are the ponds in the middle where God's working desperately to save us and Satan and his minions are working desperately to destroy us so just keep that in mind I don't mean ponds like we're worthless I just mean we're like we're the collateral damage right they're trying to take us down because they can't take God down so in verse 8 here but Daniel purpose in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat north of wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the unix that he might not defile himself okay so Daniel sees he goes to the restaurant he sits down he gets the menu and he's like okay this is all unclean here I don't want anything to do with this you know can we go somewhere else so he's making a request that hey I don't want to defile myself can you please give me something different can you let us eat according to our God and what our God calls us to do so you too must purpose in your heart that the world will not defile you look at that in verse 8 he purposed he purposed there in his heart that he would not be defiled by the world Daniel purposed that he had said I promise that you can tell in the language here before Daniel was ever drug off to Babylon before he faced the fight and the temptation he had at purposed in his heart that he would not he would not abandon his God and part of the key for you and I as a Christian in this world today is that you need to be purposed in your heart that when temptation arises you will not succumb to it long before it hits you long before it's given in front of your life you've got you've got to purpose that before the attack otherwise you could be and be taken out by the enemy look at number 6 1 through 4 and the Lord spake Anamosa saying speak under the children of Israel and say to them when either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarete to separate themselves under the Lord he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink and shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes nor eat moist grapes or dried all the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree from the kernels even to the husk so separation got that Nazarete vow of obviously Samson's famous for taking that with not cutting his hair and all that but the Nazarete vow um separating yourself from the things of the world now that doesn't say what that's what Daniel was doing but that that motivation in your heart of wanting to be separated from the world that's the key now 1 Corinthians 10 21 you cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils you cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and of the table of devils so Daniel knew this he couldn't take the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons at the same time he would be betraying his God so in verse 9 here now God had brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the prince of the unix so Daniel was but not only beloved by God God made sure Daniel was beloved by everyone around him as well which is really a neat thing now he brought him into favor but why because his heart was humble and pointed toward the Lord it's the same thing God did for Joseph look at Genesis 39 verse 21 but the Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy and gave him favor in the side of the keeper of the prison so you know a lot of us we go through our lives here you're going to come into contact with a lot of people that are very adamantly against God um their hostile towards our king their hostile maybe towards you as a Christian if you will humble yourself to God God can do the same thing for you in your life that he did for Daniel and Joseph and give you favor in their sight remember in Jesus said you're going to heap coal's a fire on their head when you when you take what the world gives you and you take it and stride and glorify your God look at Acts 7 9 through 10 and the patriarchs moved with envy sold Joseph into Egypt but God was with him and delivered him out of all the afflictions and gave him favor and wisdom in the side of Pharaoh king of Egypt and he made him governor over Egypt in all his house how cool is that you know Joseph and Daniel men that were humble for God taking his slaves that God out of that prison raises up to be prime minister in the dominant world empire okay in verse 10 here in the prince of the eunuch said unto Daniel I fear my Lord the king who at the point of your meat and your drink for why should he see your faces who is liking then the children which are of your sort then shall you make me endanger my head to the king so what he's saying to Daniel is if I let you do this and you come in before the king and you still look like you're a starved you know slave who hasn't had anything to eat for years meanwhile so what he's saying is meanwhile your brothers who are here with you they're taking of the king's meat and they come in nourished highly you know high in stature and their their muscular whatever they look healthy and they come into the court and you look like this scrawny rut you know who didn't eat anything for years the king's going to kill me I'm going to endanger myself if I allow you to do this what it tells you to is that Daniel and his three friends may have been alone in making this demand the other the other Israelites that were drug off in captivity may have been saying finally whatever you want me to just spare my life so he may have been standing alone in this with his three buddies which says a lot about Daniel much like Joshua and Caleb who we just studied you know standing alone in front of a congregation of a couple million people that they could take the giants so just keep that in mind oftentimes in your life doing what God wants you to do is sometimes a lonely path but you've got to be okay with that just recognize that there's a lot of people in the Bible that took that path Jeremiah 39 6 through 7 then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah moreover he had put out Zedekiah's eyes and bound him with chains to carry him to Babylon now look at Jeremiah 29 verse 22 and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which are in Babylon saying the Lord make the like Zedekiah and like a have whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire look at what Daniel is standing against Nebuchadnezzar was a wicked brutal king I mean he he didn't just take nations captive he tortured them he roasted people in the fire he Zedekiah the king of Israel is the one who turned his back on God God was hungry to humble himself and Serenadeh to Nebuchadnezzar and he'd be saved Jeremiah and Ezekiel both came to him and said you're you're going to die in Babylon one of them said you're never going to see Babylon and Zedekiah laughed at them and yet he thought they were they were mixing up their story from God would he never see it or would he or would he die there or would he never see it and Nebuchadnezzar there in Jeremiah 39 6 through 7 puts his eyes out and drags him off to Babylon where he dies so exactly what God said was true he died there yet he never saw it but Nebuchadnezzar did that to his captives he would do things like that to try a strike fear into the nations he was taking over so this is what Daniel is facing and you know it's easy to read this story and think of well yeah Daniel just told the prison guard like hey give me some vegetables and water and I'll be fine he was facing a very very pagan dark demonic society living in a place where he did not know what was going to happen to him if he stood for his God and my question to all of us is you know would you have reacted different I know a lot of people a lot of Christians like to say you know when that guns pointed to your head you would never deny Jesus you have to to actually come through with that and be able to stand in your faith in that moment the preparation is now it's not at that time you've got to be you've got to be someone that's purposed in your heart and committed now that you'll never deny your king before that time happens so just keep that in mind okay Daniel verse 11 here then said Daniel to Melzar whom the princes of the unix had set over Daniel Hennonaya Michel and Aziraya so this is the guy that's in charge of them so Daniel's going to him and saying hey prove thy servants in verse 12 I besiege the 10 days and let them give us pulse to eat and water to drink so in verse 12 Daniel's saying okay I understand your your issue your issue is if we come into the king and we look like we've been starved for three years you're gonna you're gonna be be headed and killed or maybe worse your family would so do this give us 10 days to eat what our God wants us to eat and in if after 10 days we still look scrawny and malnourished and pale or whatever the issue is then fine we'll do it your way but if we look good and we're and we're healthy and strong you see what our gods doing in our lives then we get to do what what we're asking so pulse it just means vegetables in Jeremiah 42 verse 7 it came to pass after 10 days that the word of the Lord came on in Jeremiah I want you to notice this 10 isn't random from Daniel 10 10 he's used to hearing this 10 days was kind of a time of of testing or setting yourself aside for a little bit look at Acts 25 or 6 and when he had Terry to mung them more than 10 days he went down on to cesarea and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought so 10 days revelation 210 this is what Jesus says to the church in that letter fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil is still shall cast some of you into prison that you may be tried and you shall have tribulation 10 days be thou faithful into death and I will give thee a crown of life we're an amazing promise by God a crown for all eternity if you can just take the temptation or the punishment for 10 days that's a pretty good deal that's a that's called an infinite return on your investment for that one okay verse 13 here then let our countenance be looked upon so Daniel's putting the test out there before the and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat and as thou seest deal with thy servants in other words Daniel's saying I know all of my brethren are bowing down to your wicked demands and they're eating meat defile and sacrifice to unto pagan idols let them do that but let us do what our God commands and put us to the test after 10 days put us with that group and see who looks better so he's he's rising up to the challenge this isn't just some you know small peasant man that's groveling before his captive he's putting him to the test and the challenge and not backing down so he consented to them in this matter and proved them 10 days and at the end of the 10 days their countenance appeared fairer and fatter and flesh than all the children which did eat the pagan idolatrous portion of the king's meat so God's ways prove superior once again now when you rely on God's substance alone you will look fairer than the world you'll be fuller you'll be happier you'll be brighter you'll be more joyful ultimately you will be more attractive to everyone around you and if any of you have have gotten on the meat of the word in your life and been around people who who knew you before and you're walking with more contentment your marriages are being successful you're you're walking around joy in your life no matter the situation people take notice they start to ask you what what's going on here you know why are you acting this way you just got this diagnosis or this is going on and it's a chance for you to give a testimony so when you live for Jesus alone the world wants to know your secret and we of all people the church we should have the answer okay I remember Gary Steermann said this years ago I heard him say this by loved his line he said we have the book we have the answer we should be the ones to be able to tell the world why and God says that right Jesus says be ready to give a reason for the hope that lives within you in verse 16 here thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat and the wine that they should drink and gave them pulse so they passed the test so to speak the litmus test if you want to use that phrase they passed the litmus test and so Melzar whose head of the unix or over them says okay I'll let you do what you're going to do now for the rest of the time you're captive before you go before the king which may have been you know two years and 40 weeks left to go here or however long so he realizes God's ways are working better and allows them to continue and then in verse 17 here as for these four children God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams so God anoints him with a prophetic gift and understanding and visions and dreams he's a dream interpreter from this point on he he's able to interpret Nebuchadnezzar's dream he has dreams later on that he interprets he passes that on to the magi in Persia years down the road and it's just a it's an amazing thing so God anoints them with this right here in verse 17 look at second Chronicles 1 10 through 12 give me now wisdom and knowledge that I may go out and come in before this people who for who can judge this thy people that is so great and God said to Solomon because this was in line heart and now is not asked riches wealth or honor nor life of thine enemies neither neither yet has asked long wife but has asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself that thou mayest judge my people over whom I have made the king wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee and I will give thee riches and wealth and honor such as none of the kings have had that have been before the neither shoulder any after the have the like now what you see there you see the the principal working here in Daniel's life and in Solomon's life was seeking first the kingdom of God and all these things will be added to you and Jesus has the same for you and I that doesn't mean if you if you're seeking God first that he's going to make you this wealthy king over some nation but he's going to gift you with eternal inheritance to rule and reign with him and seeking him first and everything else is then granted to you later and now in terms of joy and contentment of direction in your life on how to live so you see that in Solomon now Solomon messed up after this remember he wasn't supposed to multiply gold silver horses or wives and he does all all of that in abundance and God tries to correct him the whole way he messes up pretty bad after this but he started out very very good God wants you to have wisdom like so many of his servants so look at Luke 2 15 for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to gain say nor resist okay give you wisdom act 722 and Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was mighty in words and in deeds James 1 5 through 7 if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that's so isn't that simple that give it to all men liberally and unabraideth not and it shall be given him but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord those are some strong words being if you study Jude Jude calls it being double-minded so going back and forth wavering like a wave tossed to and fro or like a cloud without rain Jude talks about who's the wind just takes it wherever it goes the ways of culture so just keep that in mind but that's a promise that is a promise from God if you lack wisdom ask God for it and look at James chapter 4 verses 2 and 3 you lust and have not you kill and desire to have and cannot obtain you fight and war yet you have not because you ask not you ask and receive not because you ask a miss that you may consume it upon your lust the principle here is the reason and the motivation behind the request so Jesus alone knows the thoughts and intents of your heart if you're asking for wisdom so that you can go and and do something great and build your own kingdom and be this incredible person the world's going to to envy or whatever it is God's not going to grant that he wants to grant and give you an anointing and a gift that you use to serve him that's the purpose so you've got a purpose in your heart it's like he talks about the Pharisees right they they fast and then they go out to the corner of the street corner and they mourn and they they tell everyone gosh now I wish I could join you for lunch but you know I'm doing this fast right now I just can't do it you know and it's this this haughty righteous attitude of look at me I'm so great and I'm better than all of you because I'm fasting right now and it's kind of like and then Jesus says they will have their reward so he's not graining them what they're trying to accomplish out of that fast so just keep that in mind the heart behind what you do for Jesus matters greatly it matters greatly and he knows why so you can't fool him in verse 18 now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in then the prince of the unix brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar so the test Daniel proposed was only 10 days but now many years had passed remember they wanted three years according to Daniel 1 verse 5 so God you are skipping ahead a lot of years here and the king commune with them and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishel and Aziraya therefore stood they before the king so may that be said of each of us when we're compared to the world my that's a strong prayer to think about in your own life that when the world looks at you they see the king in your life whom you serve and there's none that stand like you stand that's a great thing to be said about your life in verse 20 and all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king inquired of he found them ten times better look at that there's that ten again then all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm so they weren't just better than the satanic wizards and sorcerers and astrologers and things they were ten times better so so Nebuchadnezzar's putting them to the test now he did something here to test them and it doesn't God doesn't say exactly what he did to test them but he did something to test them they waited and survived only on the Lord's provision for ten days and were found ten times better and I think that's not a coincidence in verse 21 here and Daniel continued even unto the first year of King Cyrus so Cyrus is then the Persian that conquers Babylon years after this time so verse 21 is kind of like a side note hey hang tight Daniel's gonna survive into this other kingdom here coming up and he actually lived beyond the first year of Cyrus and Daniel chapter 10 we'll see that so as a prisoner Daniel never lost sight of where his hope provision protection and guidance rested and it was not in the world and it was not in the riches and the meat of the king's table and that's important the world the world has much to offer you you can get a seat of the king's table in that sense in a lot of different ways but there's nothing there for you as a Christian there's nothing there for you as a follower of Christ who's to be a pilgrim in this world and not a permanent resident you're to be sojourning through he was completely relying on God he needed discernment from God's word that he was studying we're a seat gonna see that he needed discernment wisdom from God he asked it and God granted it to him his word gave Daniel the the ability to resist evil to build his faith it gave him the power to voice disagreement when needed but in a loving manner in a way that honored his king not in one that was beating and tearing people apart and it provided him physical courage physical courage i think that's important we saw the importance of that six years ago he was able to preserve because of God's word Daniel was determined to not give in because he knew what God required so his close relationship to God provided meekness and i it doesn't necessarily say this there in chapter one as we read through it but my sense is that Daniel also drew strength because he was with like-minded men in his community hand in eye amicia as a rye who they too were with him united in this of saying hey we're gonna serve the Lord and not back down there's there is strength in that that's why God promises one will put a thousand of flight but two ten thousand you know there's strength in you communing with the body and being around like-minded believers who are chasing after Christ who are there to support you through challenges and trials and we're seeing that now why that's important here in Daniel but who really was in charge you know this whole time nebuchadnezzar is probably thinking i've got this figured out like i've conquered Israel i'm dragging them off captive but God gave them over to nebuchadnezzar that's in verse two we just read God caused the officer to show them favor in verse nine God gave them Daniel and them knowledge skill and wisdom understanding seems like God's kind of in the middle of all of this and really writing the script here which is important and again keep that that principle of you've got to have the right heart motive in all of this and be purposed in it long before you face the trial the preparation for war doesn't come when the war happens you've got to be prepared long before that you know the time to put on the armor of God is before you run out to the battlefield not when you're in it trying to figure out what to do so Daniel was a captive in a wicked society and yet he never stopped serving God and i think that this is so applicable to us today he did not eat the food forbidden by his God he did not bow down to the golden statue we're gonna see in chapter later on after chapter two the Holy Spirit does not mention him even in that event he's conspicuously not mentioned with his three friends there he did not stop praying to God he'd not fear the lines then we're gonna see when Persia takes over and really the question is who will you serve and Daniel is setting that model of who to serve and as we studied in Joshua the last chapter in Joshua verse 15 and if it seems evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods what your father served they were on the other side the flood or the gods of the amirites and whose land you dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord you've got to purpose this now in your life that you're going to serve the Lord every single thing this world has to offer is built on shifting sand everything there is nothing in this world for you to grab a hold of and build a life on the only thing you can build your life on is the solid rock of Jesus Christ and nothing else and everything else will get washed away at some point and fail so just keep that in mind you've got to wake up every single day and before your feet even hit the floor dedicate the day to the king and just ask him what would you have on me this day and just listen when you're in his word and you're listening to him he's gonna speak to you and that still small voice and direct your paths and give you discernment and wisdom on what to do with the gift he's anointed you with the enemy the first place the enemy will attack you in your life is whatever your anointing is you have a gift given to you personally by God when he created you in your mother's womb when he formed you according to Psalms 139 he was forming you in the depth of the earth long before you were even conceived he had you in mind and he has a gift for you that he's giving you in the first place you get attacked in your life is on that gift you may be a teacher you may be a writer you may be a songwriter you may have a gift of healing you may whatever it is a prayer warrior maybe one that gives maybe one that is a gift of of hospitality of welcoming people into your life or your house or recognizing needs in the body of Christ whatever that gift is the enemy wants to mute it and put it aside long before you get a chance to do anything with it for the king and so just keep that in mind if you're going through something in your life think about what you're being attacked in and nine times out of ten it's going to be in whatever God has gifted you in maybe administration whatever it is so go to the Lord with it then the key is to go to the Lord and just say God I want you to show me how you want me to use this gift and you plead the blood of Jesus over the door frame of your life and according to Luke 1019 you have all authority to tread over every foul and unclean spirit of this realm because he has the authority it's nothing to do with you necessarily it's who lives inside of you and that's a miraculous thing so if you're here if you don't know the Lord it's very simple it's Romans 109 that if thou shall confess with them with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shall believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead you shall be saved you have to yield the strongest member of your body your tongue remember James says if you can bridle the tongue you can bridle the whole body so if you can bridle your tongue if you confess the name above all names the name of Jesus Christ you shall be saved and born again instantaneously and you do not have to add anything to it you cannot add anything to the finished work of Jesus on the cross otherwise there's not a single person in this room that would be saved still because you're not good enough no priest is good enough to to confess your sins for you no sacrament or sacrifice or any other thing the world would try you to do to add something to what Jesus did on the cross it's not what he did as the son of God plus something you have to do afterwards it's by his blood and only his blood that you are born again and have eternal life with the king at that point then it's a matter of what do you do with your salvation that is then the challenge and in that when you're born again that's you will get an onslaught of attack from the enemy on what God has gifted you to do think about Moses God wanted him to go speak and what did he say Lord I slow speech I can't do this and he was being tempted he God didn't have any intent to bring Aaron along beside him to speak for him he wanted Moses to do it now God turned that and used it for good but originally Moses was to go do that he was getting attacked and where he was gifted and so keep that in mind but if you will yield your life to the king confess that name Jesus you will be born again the thief on the cross could do nothing but declare Jesus was Lord remember he said Jesus Lord and that was it and he was saved immediately and Jesus said today you will be with me in paradise that thief could not get down off that cross and be baptized he couldn't give to the poor he could not go out and feed the hummus he couldn't go and tie that his local church he couldn't do anything else he didn't even have on the right attire he was hanging there completely stripped down naked on the cross and all he could do was say Jesus your king saved me and he was with him for every eternity now that testimony has echoed ever since the enemy people have been saved on their deathbed because of what that thief did because they have the testimony written in God's word that you don't have to add anything to salvation Jesus was enough the Nikkei is what do you do with it so if you're here if you need that if you need to be born again I pray that you do that this day God we thank you so much for this time together God I pray that you would pour your spirit out over this place and over the door frame of our lives God we plead the blood of Jesus that God you would go to fight for us that you would war for our families God we are canceling any assignment in the war room of Satan over this generation that Lord you have a plan for a generation that will seek your face oh God and so Lord we just pray that you would raise up a generation whose identity is not confused that somehow you messed up when you knit them together in their mother's womb they are either male or female because you created them that way not because you made a mistake and so God this confusion from the enemy this trying to creep into this generation Lord we plead the blood of Jesus and pray that you would cancel it right now and that that that tactic by the enemy would turn back and swallow in themselves Lord the pit that they dug let them fall in and the stone they rolled let it fall back on them just as you declared in Psalms and God we pray that out of that would be a generation that is so strong and committed to you and standing on the rock of Jesus that Lord the enemy turns and cowardice and fear and runs the other way never to try to attack them again and God we pray that your word would be planted in the midst of this time in this earth and that your word would go out to the ends of the earth and back and that you would call many to repentance and to salvation and get them into the ark before you call us home in the rapture of the church Lord God I pray that your word would stir in the hearts and the minds of people in Iran and in Syria and in Israel and in Africa God we pray that you would stop the genocide of your people that are running and looking for your word just as a place to worship out in the jungle somewhere in villages with their people God protect them with the fire of the Holy Ghost show them where to walk where to lead Lord where to travel if they need to to escape and God we pray that your word would no longer be stifled in China God as they try to rewrite it with satanic algorithms and AI in their schools God we pray that whatever they are trying to use whatever computer program or AI they're trying to use to rewrite your word and to put a false word in their school houses God I pray that those systems would have no choice but to write the true word of God and that they would be they'd be blinded by it and I even recognize that it is your word Lord for in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God the same in the beginning was God and Lord we pray that you would get that into the underground church in China they're so desperate to have a copy of the Bible and Lord as you all know a hurrari stands up and says AI is going to rewrite the entire Bible on this earth God we plead Psalms 2 right now that Lord you sit in the heavens and laugh and we'll have them in derision because your word stands long before they even took their first breath your word was here and it will be here long after and so God let them see that they are calling out and making war with the king of the universe and they do not want to go any further and so God I just pray that you would have them in derision and that you would laugh in the heavens because who are they to stand up and declare that they're going to make war with the God of Abraham so God I just pray that right now you would let peace blanket this earth and give your church a time and a window the season right now to go out to minister Lord to share our testimonies to show the world what it means to live for Jesus and to see him so God be with us in this place as we continue to study the book of Daniel and I just pray that your word would go out to the ends of the earth and back thank you Lord for this time together in your matchless name we pray God amen amen you'll have a great Sunday"

It's a privilege to be able to be here with you this weekend and teach God's Word. I've got a quick question, a little icebreaker. How many of you guys have already started to take down your Christmas stuff? How many of you guys have you started but you still have stuff up? Yeah, if you're liking me you're like, I'm not taking everything down, that was a lot of work. I'm going to milk this for one more week at least. How many of you have taken everything down? It's all gone. All right, hold on, keep your hands up, keep your hands up. All right, everybody look at these people. These people hate Christmas. They hate Christmas. So scoot over in your seat. You don't want to sit near them. Golly, we got cameras in here. We got pictures of every single one of you. We're going to put it on the screen next week. No, I'm excited to be with you. I hope you guys enjoyed your Christmas and the holidays and the new year. Today we'll be continuing our study in 2nd Samuel chapter 14 like Billy said. And so if you have your bibles, go ahead and turn there if you haven't yet. And while you do that, I'm going to pray for our time and invite the Lord. Holy Spirit, we welcome you. And God, I know very well that it's you who speaks to us. It's you who brings your word to life. You're the one who leads us into all truth. You're the one who illuminates things who gives us eyes to see and ears to hear. And so Holy Spirit, we welcome you. And Lord, I ask that this wouldn't just be another time where we kind of go through the motions, but God, I ask that we would hear from you. We would come to this place and we would meet with our maker. And so God, would you use your word? Would you use me? Lord, I pray that I would decrease, that you would increase, that the flesh would be no part of this. But Lord, that your word would reign and God, that your spirit would speak and God, maybe it's not even something I have to say, but Lord, maybe you're just going to deposit a thought in somebody's heart today as they're sitting in your house. So God, we're open. We just submit our hearts to you right now and we're thankful. We're thankful that you're a God that still speaks. You speak through your word and God, we want to hear your voice. And so Holy Spirit, we welcome you. We thank you for this time and we pray this in the name of Jesus, amen. The title of this message is collateral damage. Before we dive in, I need to recap a bit for you. You might be new. This might be like your New Year's resolution. You're like, let me come check out this church's cavalry chapel on Broad Street. And so if you're here, you probably aren't familiar with where we're at on our passage. And really, the truth is after Christmas, everything's kind of a blur. Maybe you've forgotten some of the stuff that's happened in 2 Samuel chapter 13, 12, some of the things that have happened recently. And so in order to rightly divide the word, we need to have context. And so I want to give you a little bit of context exactly where we're at. Within the last few chapters, we've seen David fail miserably. You may be familiar with the story. David takes for himself another man's wife. He impregnates her and then he successfully plots the murder of her husband. This is by far the greatest failure of David's life. And from this moment on, David and his family would never be the same. This failure would haunt him for the remainder of his life. And though he would ultimately be forgiven by God, the consequences of his sin would be significant. It was Nathan the prophet himself who made this clear to David. He essentially said to him, the Lord has forgiven you. However, you will pay a dear price for your sin. The consequence of his sin was that from this day forward adversity and disaster would rise from his household. His household was going to be sh- it was going to be shambles. And this has already started to take place. Last week we saw a tragic event occur between David's oldest son, Amnon, and his half-sister, David's daughter, Tamar. In summary, Amnon, David's son raped his own sister and after this took place, she fled and found refuge with her brother, Absalom, another one of David's sons. As you can imagine, Absalom was filled with rage after waiting two years and seeing David passively do nothing, did nothing over what Amnon did with his daughter, Tamar. He absolutely did nothing. Absalom decides to take matters into his own hands. Absalom, he devises a plan to kill his brother, Amnon, and ultimately his plan was successful. Now he's on the run. What we're witnessing is the continued downfall of David and ultimately his family. So we begin to see the prophecy of Nathan is unfolding. David has already lost the life of the baby he had conceived with Bishiba. His daughter had now been raped by his own son, Amnon, and Amnon is now dead through the plotting of his other son, Absalom. Maybe you've heard this quote before. Sin will take you farther than you wanted to go. It will keep you longer than you wanted to stay and it'll make you pay more than you wanted to pay. It'll cost you more than you wanted to pay. You know what sin is for the unbeliever? It's a bad deal. It's a bad deal. It's something that you think you're like, this is going to go great, but you get to the other side and you realize that was a bad deal. I got the bad end of that. Maybe even for example, you bought some stuff for Christmas. You were at the store and they had a sticker on it and you were like, sweet, like this is a good deal. And then you got home and you looked online and you realized it was $50 cheaper online. That's what sin does that to us every single time. It's like, it never pans out. It always leaves us empty. It never satisfies. And in fact, the consequences of sin always outweigh the momentary satisfaction, the momentary pleasure. It's empty. We lose when we choose sin. And in this case, David is losing a lot. I would say he is losing the most important thing we could ever have and it's our family. Listen to what Glacian 6 says on this says, do not be deceived. And now this verse right here, this verse should haunt us. It should be something that puts the fear of God in us. It should be something that we have in our back pocket that we consider all the time. It says, do not be deceived. God is not mocked. For whatever a man shows that he will also reap. For he who shows to the flesh will up the flesh reap corruption, but he who shows to the spirit will up the spirit reap everlasting life. What this means is that what you so will grow. Whatever seeds you put in the ground, they're going to grow. And there are some seeds that you'd wish you didn't so. St. Owee's has collateral damage. It cannot only destroy you, but also your family. Friday morning, I woke up. I was getting ready to study for this. It's like 530. My daughter, I hear Salah, she's 2 years old. I hear her crying. I'm like, all right, I'm going to put this down, I'm going to go up there, I'm going to go hold my daughter. So I'm holding Salah and I'm looking at her. Sometimes what happens is you can read a passage like this and you can detach from the reality of it. We can not think things through. I remember holding her and I'm looking at her and I just had this thought, David at one point held his daughter, Tamar. And if you've ever held a newborn before, you look at it and you're just like, oh my God, this is the innocence. This is so pure. This is only God could do something like this, right? And I think about, that was David's daughter. And now at this point, he goes, I'm sure he's considering like, how do we get here? How do we get here? I remember holding her. How do we get here? Maybe his son's too. Maybe he held them too. How do we get here? How is my family in this place? How has everything started to fall apart? And even yesterday morning, I woke up my other daughter, Hally, I got two daughters, I got one on the way too. So I got three daughters. So you can really pray for me. It's like Barbies and yeah, I mean my house is like pink. That whole thing is pink. So my wife loves it. But my other daughter woke up, 5.30 a.m. once again, she's scared. She's saying daddy. So I go up there and I'm holding her. She's three years old and I'm holding her. And it dawned on me. Like she's like scared and who she looking for. She's looking for her dad because it's actually instinctual to her that her dad is to protect her. And it's instinctual to us as well. When I first had my daughter, Hally, she was our first born. When I had her, the first thought I had and this is, you know, this is kind of what you get. I'm just going to share what I actually said. And you know, sometimes that gets me in trouble, but I'm alright. I'm holding Hally. And the first thought I had, I swear to you, I said it to Natalie, she's my witness. I go, I would kill a thousand men for this little girl and I would sleep well doing it. Like that's how much. And then I had my second daughter and I'm like, I would kill a thousand more men for this little girl. I would kill more and more and more men if I had to for these little girls, like protecting our children. It's like our instinct. It's like the idea is that like if somebody's going to come to our house, like I'm the one who meets them at the door, right? That's like that's what that's who we are. That's what we are called to do as the fathers of the household, right? Well, David, the warrior king got taken out by the enemy and his own wicked desires and now his family is left there on the battlefield. They're completely vulnerable. To the men, the fathers in here, may we pay very close attention to this, to the continued chapters in this book for surely like David, the enemy desires to still kill and destroy us. But not only us, our families, if he can take us out, he can surely get to them. And so we would do well to look at David and go, there's a target on my back too. I'm reminded of an article I once read about a child predator and in this article, they interviewed the man and one of the questions they asked him is, how did you choose your victims to which the man replied? I would look for the child without a strong father figure. I would look for the child who had a passive, dismissive, non-present, unintentional father is what he said. That's demonic. That's demonic and the enemy would say the same thing he's looking. He's looking to come for our families. May this not be any man within the sound of my voice, would God rid us of this passive heart that we're seeing in David? Now when I say passive, don't hear me wrong, there's a difference between patience and tactfulness and wisdom. And maybe you're not some guy that's like, I'm going to go get up and flip tables and that's fine. You don't have to be like that. That's not what I'm talking about. Passiveness and detachment, that's like, it's like not being intentional, not investing. It's a disinterest and familial responsibility. It's the idea of like having a calling and not taking it seriously. And like God's created you to do something and it's not your priority. And remember, I mentioned I have daughters and about to have a third one. When I say this, trust me, I'm speaking to myself. But you know what we don't need right now? We don't need more passive men. The world would tell you to be passive. They want you to sit down, shut up. We don't need more of that. We need men to stand up to fight for our families in this land that God has given us. The Lord took 12 men and changed the entire world. What could he do with all of the men in this room? What could he do with all of the men at Calvary Chapel, Chattanooga? And as we've been continuously going through the book of 1st and 2nd Samuel, this theme has been relentless. The theme would be that of a warning. You know, it's almost like if you've ever been pulled over, which by the way, Pastor Tyler Goldson's right there, make sure you ask him about his speeding ticket that he got a few weeks ago. I get to do this to him because he always does this to me because he teaches. But now I'm up here. So everybody, if every person in here could ask him, like, hey man, how fast are you going? Just ask him. Anyways, if you've ever been pulled over and you're sitting there and you're in this, the car seat, it feels like forever. I mean, you got the guy behind you, you got this blue light and it's just flashing and it feels like it must have spun around 5,000 times. By the time the guy gets there, it's like you've got hit with this blue light in your face, 5,000 times. And I don't know what the police officers do if there's any police officers in here. What takes you guys so long? Like, what are you, are you playing words with friends on your phone or something? Well, first and second Samuel, it's been that. It's been like this constant warning. And maybe you've gotten sick of it. You're like, man, every time, there's this warning, don't get sick of it. Don't get sick of it. There's a reason. There's a reason for the warning. God's word is alive and it's active and for whatever reason, this is what God is speaking to us. And it's almost like the warning goes something like this. Man or woman of God, don't go down this road if you do it will not end well. The warning could be you're actually in the middle of it and he's telling you, get out of it or it could be you're not in the middle of it and he's telling you, take heed, lest you fall. We're all susceptible. For whatever reason, God has divinely chosen to take Calvary Chapel, Chattanooga through the books of first and second Samuel with Saul and David and all of these failures. And you know what? These warnings are so valuable and many have responded to the warnings already. Many have responded. And even I think about a young man who came up to me, this was after Pastor Tim's teaching in December and he came up to me and he's just like, hey man, I'm done. I'm done. I am sick of it. I am sick of the sin that has been holding me down. I've been watching this stuff since I was 10 years old. Nobody knows. I'm 24 now. I'm stuck in it. I want to be married. I want to have a family. I want to get free. Can you help me? That's why we go through passages like this. And if you're in here and you've heard warning after warning after warning, what if today is the day where God's like, finally, you heard the warning. Praise God that many people have already responded in the prayer is that many more will. And if you're caught in some sort of sin and you need to get free, we would love to walk with you. I don't just say that and we don't just say that. Just because it's a big church, we've got time for you. That's what we are here for. We exist for you. And so if you have to get, if you need to get free like that young man did and you're like, hey, I just need some people to walk with. Come up front or come find somebody who works here or send us an email and we'll set up a meeting. And I just have to say this, I love our church. I love that we have a church that teaches verse by verse and chapter by chapter. We don't cherry pick and I went to Nashville one time, which that could tell you all you need to know about. It's a big place, but I went to this church and it was, I walked in there and I'm like, ready. You know, the worship was great. The worship is always great, right? But they get ready to teach the word and the dude doesn't even, he doesn't even have a Bible. He doesn't even, he's talking more about himself than anything. And I'm sitting there and I'm just like, why am I even here? Like I don't care to hear about this. I care to hear this. This is what changes lives. This is the voice of God, right? And our church, we take this seriously. We go chapter by chapter and verse by verse because every single word is inspired. That second Timothy would say, all scripture is inspired by God. And it's profitable for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, for training, and righteousness so that the man of God may be complete and equipped for every good work. Now may God continue to equip us this weekend and in the coming weeks. Let's dive in, verse one. So Joab, the son of Zeraya perceived that the king's heart was concerned about Absalom. And at the end of chapter 13, it tells us that at this point, three years had gone by since Absalom had plotted the murder of Amnon. So now it says David was concerned about Absalom. He was concerned about him. Another word used there would be David Longferum. David was drawn towards him. However, David is in a pretty difficult situation here. As mentioned, his first son, Amnon, raped his daughter. David passively did nothing about it for two years, mind you. And now because of that, his own son has taken matters into his own hands. According to the Levitical Law, both Amnon and now Absalom were deserving of death. David was king, and the king's duty was to uphold the law. This proved to be a difficult task for him to say the least, especially when it came to his own children. David is stuck between a rock and a hard place. All eyes are on him. We have to realize, David was a public figure. Like everybody knew what David was doing and what was happening with David. They didn't have Twitter or X, but like everybody knew, everybody knew that David's son had raped his daughter. That news had traveled. And everybody watched how he handled that situation. Everyone now knows what Absalom did in response to Amnon, and they're waiting to see how will David handle this situation. Several million people at this time. That's how many people are watching David's life. And here's what makes all of this a bit more complex. Bear with me. Amnon was David's first born child, which means he was the heir to the throne. And now that Amnon was dead, the next in line would have been David's second son, whose name was Chilliab. However, it is believed that Chilliab died at a young age because after 2 Samuel, chapter 3, he's never mentioned again. Therefore Absalom becomes the son that everyone is expecting to become king. And this becomes even more apparent toward the end of our chapter. So in a sense, Amnon is now dead. Absalom should be the rightful heir to the throne, but Absalom has committed a capital offense. So all eyes are on David. What does he do? He essentially puts it off and does not address it. He presses further into his passive nature, and he neglects his responsibility as king and a father. Absalom has been banished as him now, but no decision has officially been made. David, the once decisive fearsome convicted king, was now passive, incapable, and lacking in discernment. That will become more apparent here in a moment. David was a shell of who he used to be. And this is what happens with sin. Sin stunts the process of sanctification. It prevents us from being who God has called us to be. David did not deal with this issue. He pushed it off, and we will see shortly the only reason it ends up getting dealt with is because he was tricked in the making of decision. It will end up being five years in total before David actually meets face to face with Absalom, and I can't help but wonder how would have all these things have turned out had David inquired of the Lord like he once did and took action. You would have thought that the David that we know would have just taken a second and been like, God, help me. I don't know what to do. Everything's going wrong. My daughters in this situation, my son did this. God, help me. I don't know what to do. And I'm of the personal belief that how David handled both of these situations with Amnon and Absalom contributed to the wickedness that was developed in Absalom's heart. We're going to see Absalom loses it. He loses it. And I just wonder, after watching his dad do nothing and then doing something, and then his dad responding in the way he did to what he, to his actions, I wonder if bitterness just like started to stir in Absalom's heart where now there's just this hatred for his father. As we see later on, he's going to try to overthrow the kingdom. I'll just say this, David pushing this off was a mistake. And if there is a situation that you know you need to deal with and you're putting it off, you should take note. Chances are if something just popped into your mind, you've got it. If you don't deal with it, there may be consequences to the decision of pushing it off. And so seeing that David isn't capable of making a decision, Joab decides to take matters into his own hands. It's almost like David is just like paralyzed. I don't know if you've ever seen somebody who's fallen into sin and sometimes they just get so defeated. It's like they lay down and they're not fighting. It's like they got knocked down and they just stay laying down. And you look at them and you're like, hey, get back up. Like, get back in the fight. Like, get in the fight. You can do this. Like, God's grace is sufficient. Come on, get in the fight. But it's almost like David's like, no, I just, I can't. He's paralyzed. Joab at this point has been a spectator of all of this. And if you don't know who Joab is, he's the commander of David's army. He's his right-hand man and he's a fierce warrior. Joab is also a man with his own opinion. And at this point, he has decided on what he thinks should be done. Joab's motives become a bit more clear later on in the passage. But it seems as though this was a strategic move on his part, which would make sense. Joab was pretty strategic. David was 60 years old at this time. And it's probable that Joab had considered this and thought, what would happen if David dies? Like, who's going to rain next? Like, this could go bad if David gets killed in war, or if he just dies. Like, this could go really bad. Their absulum was the person. Now there's nobody. There's no heir to the throne. This could cause a civil war. Perhaps he thought something like this. Absulum was the frontrunner. Let's get him back in the kingdom, maybe even trying to secure his own position in the kingdom with Absulum. Regardless of his reasoning, Joab knew Absulum couldn't come home unless David gave permission. So Joab devises a plan and this plan was not so original. Verse two. And Joab sent it to Koa and brought from their wise woman and said to her, please pretend to be a mourner and put on mourning apparel. Do not annoy yourself with oil, but act like a woman who has been mourning a long time for the dead. Go to the king and speak to him in this manner so Joab put the words in her mouth. The plan was, let's create a hypothetical story that guides David to a conclusion. Now does this sound familiar to anybody? It should. This happened once before with David. You may remember in 2nd Samuel chapter 12, this is after David had committed the murder of Eureia and had slept with Bishiba. Nathan the prophet comes to David and he goes, hey, I want to tell you about something that happened, a story. And he goes to David and he goes, here's the story. There was a rich man and there was a poor man. The rich man had many cattle and many sheep. The poor man had one little sheep and he loved the sheep and he took care of the sheep and he fed the sheep and it was his only sheep. And then the rich man, he ends up having a bunch of guests come over and he decides, you know what? I need to throw a feast. And so what the rich man does is the rich man goes and he gets a sheep. But he doesn't take one of his own sheep from his many sheep. What does he do? He goes to the poor man and he takes his one little sheep, his precious sheep. To which David responds and goes, who did this? Who would do something like this? We need justice to be served. But go find the man who did this. To which Nathan responds and says, you did it. You're the man. For you took the sheba, you're rias, wife, and you took her for yourself. David is absolutely in shambles at this point and he repents. Well, something similar is about to happen. Let's watch as the plan unfolds, verse 4. And when the woman of Tukkoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and prostrated herself and said, help, oh, king. So she's selling it. Help. Everything's going wrong. Help. I need help. She's selling it. Joab chose the right person. Verse 5. Then the king said to her, what troubles you? And she answered, indeed, I am a widow. My husband is dead. Now your maid servant had two sons and the two sons fought with each other in the field and there was no one to part them but the one struck the other and killed him. Verse 7. And now the whole family has risen up against your maid servant and they said, deliver him who struck his brother that we may execute him for the life of his brother whom he killed. And we will destroy the heir also. So they would extinguish my ember that is left and leave to my husband, neither name nor remnant on the earth. According to the law, her surviving son was guilty and he should be slain. Nevertheless, she is requesting that the king pardon the surviving son. Verse 8. Then the king said to the woman, go to your house and I will give orders concerning you. David here kind of tries to sidestep it and send her away once again. He's kind of pressing into his passive nature. He's like, I can't deal with this right now. And the woman was not going to take this for an answer. She puts the press on him. Verse 9. And the woman of Tukkoah said to the king, my Lord, oh, king, let the iniquity be on me and on my father's house and the king and his throne be guiltless. She goes, essentially, I will take the blame if there's any uproar. Like it's on me. Verse 10. So the king said, whoever says anything to you, bring him to me and he shall not touch you anymore. Essentially, if anyone has a problem with you, bring them to me. They'll have to deal with me. Verse 11. Then she said, please let the king remember the Lord your God. And do not permit the avenger of blood to destroy anymore, lest they destroy my son and he said, as the Lord lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground. Now this woman she brings got into the picture and David grants her request, but not only that, he takes an oath in the Lord's name. He says, before the Lord, not one hair of your son will fall to the ground. She's got him right where she wants him after all. If David agreed to protect a guilty son whom he did not know before the Lord, how much more was he obligated to protect his own son, whom he loved? Now it says something here that I just personally could not get past in my time of study. She says, please let the king remember the Lord. This is the first time the Lord has mentioned since David got called out for his sin, repented, and then lost his newborn in chapter 12. And I find that fascinating. Several years has gone by and not once throughout all of this depravity do we see David turn to the Lord? As mentioned before, we don't see him, God I don't know what to do about this situation, help me, we don't see that. Now maybe he did, but based on the decisions he's been making, I find that hard to believe. And it's not recorded in scripture at all. We don't see it. We used to see it. Last year I taught on David in the sheepfold, I loved, it was one of the, yeah, it's the best passage I could have ever studied. I loved it. And I taught on that. And my favorite thing about David was his relationship with God. You want to talk about a guy who loved the Lord and just inquired of him and everything that he did. I mean, you would see it all over scripture first and second, first Samuel and then the beginning of a second. You would see God, like Lord, should I go fight? Like should I go here and fight? Like are we going to win? You would see that. You'd see him before Goliath. He was like in the name of the Lord. Like I'll take you down. The Lord was with me with the bear. He was with me with the lion. He'll be no different right now. Who defies my God. Like David had this relationship with the Lord. It was evident. It was evident. And it seems to be non-existent here. What happened to this David that we used to know? Well, maybe it's the same thing that happens to us. Right? We've all been here before where we're caught in sin. We carry shame and we distance ourselves from this holy God, much like Adam and Eve in the garden. Maybe you're in here right now. There's just a bit of distance between you and him for whatever reason. We say to ourselves, who am I to go to him? Look what I've done. He doesn't want anything to do with me. But God would look at you and he would say, come to me, all you who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest. He would say, come confess for I am faithful and just to forgive you. He would say, I will cast your sins as far as the east is from the west. He would say, I will wash you wider than snow. He would say, you're more than a conqueror through what I've done on the cross. He would say, it's finished. And if you're in here and you find yourself in this place, where there's just been a distance that's been created because of some sin that you've fallen into, I would encourage you to look at the life of David and see what happens when you stay distant. Thanks be to God that we live on this side of history where we can look to the cross and we are reminded that he made a way for us to enter in that we might inquire of the Lord at any moment in any season in spite of our sin that we may boldly come and receive grace in a time of need. Anybody grateful for that? When's the last time you've inquired of the Lord? When's the last time I've inquired of the Lord? Think about this. Like you're in the middle of a marriage and you're like, man, we're fighting. God, we've got it. This has to, something has to change. It's just been we've been budding heads over. Holy Spirit, help me. God, help me. Help me to be who I've called to be. God, help me to love my wife the way. Maybe you're trying to parent. You're like, God, I don't know how to parent. I didn't have a dad. I didn't have a mom. I don't know how, I don't know this situation. Like what do I do? How do I navigate this? Like are you inquiring of him? Are you inviting him into your life and your situations, your circumstances? Are you at work and you're like, God, I want to honor you at work? God, I don't know. It's a bad environment. People are trying to ask me to cut corners. I don't feel good about God. I don't, are you talking dialoguing with your God? Maybe it's your finances. You go, God, it's hard. You got to inquire. I've got it's hard. God, I don't know. You got to make a way. I don't know. I'm looking at these numbers. God, I don't know how this is going to happen. I don't know. God, are you inquiring of him in those moments or are you just doing it on your own? If it's been a few months and you found yourself just not inquiring of him, that's a bad sign. It should be your inclination to run to him. I've told this story before with our youth, but this is a story that I first heard this when I got saved. I was 18 years old when I got saved. This story changed my life. It's a story that kind of goes like this. It's about a father who's sitting at the fireplace and he's in his chair and there's another chair there and he's drinking his coffee. It's about a son who's like 16, 17 years old, much like I was, who was just too busy and just did whatever he wanted and he's upstairs. One of the things he does every morning is he goes downstairs and he looks to the right and he sees his father sitting at the fireplace and every single morning what he does is he makes a decision and the decision is this. I think I'm just going to go out the door. I'm not going to say anything to my father. I'm not going to go sit with him. I'm just going to go out the door and he goes out the door, right? And all of a sudden he goes out the door. He comes back and he's in the hurry. You know, he's like, I'm back. My dad's sitting there again. That's interesting. Well, yeah, I'm in a hurry. He goes upstairs. He sits down. He goes to sleep. He wakes up. He does it day after day. Now, son, it's been weeks. Now, son, it's been years and now, son, his father's almost like a stranger. It's almost like there's no relationship with his dad anymore. And he kind of gets in this circumstance where he realizes like something's going wrong in his life and he needs some help and he finally comes to the conclusion like, hey, maybe the guy I've been walking past every morning, like maybe I should go talk to him. And so he does. He wakes up one morning and he goes and he goes and he sits down with his father and you know what most people would expect to happen? Because this is the brokenness of humanity. What we'd expect is that the father would go, where have you been? About time you showed up. Oh, now you want to sit down with me? But no, no, no, that's not what the father does. The father goes, I'm so glad that you're here. I know you've been busy, but I'm so glad you're here. I'm glad you made time right now. And you know what? Tell me what you've been doing. Catch me up. What are you working through? How can I help? How can I walk with you in this? I'm so glad you came. Come sit with me tomorrow. I'll see you tonight, son. I can't wait to see you. And you know what? That might be where you're at or you're like, man, I've been rushing out the door. I've been rushing out the door. My father's been sitting there the whole time. I would encourage you right now. If that's you and you're you're feeling the stirring. God's telling you, come sit with me. Come sit with me. I'm there. Make some time. I know we wake up and what happens is we've got this, this, this, and this. As soon as we wake up, I got to do all this stuff. And if you got kids, it's this, this, this, this, this, this, this, it's like a thousand more things, right? And you're like, oh, man, but I'm telling you this, if you could be intentional to inquire of the Lord, if you can meet with him, it will change your life. It's the very thing you were created to do. And this may be the word for you this weekend. Boldly come inquire of the Lord. Are you dirty? Let him wash you. Are you in the middle of a mess? Ask him for wisdom. Are you tired? Plead with him for strength. We must remember that inquiring of the Lord is a lifelong necessity. Would we be people who go after God's heart in every season of our lives? And you know, I haven't, I haven't said this. And so maybe it's just for somebody in here, but I just think about how David inquired of the Lord for the first half of his life, but the second half, it didn't, it didn't look great. And if you're in here and you're finishing and you're trying to finish strong and you're trying to finish well, maybe God's like, hey, take notes from David, keep inquiring of me. If you're at, if you're on the back half, keep it finished strong, I went to go see the David movie with my daughter. You know what's crazy about the David movie? There's no David too. There's no David too. And for you guys, would there be a David too? Would there be a second half that is better than the first half? Now here it comes. David is about to realize he got fooled again, verse 12. And therefore, the woman said, please let your maidservant speak another word to my Lord, the king. And he said, and so the woman said, why then have you skamed such a thing against the people of God? There it is. For the king speaks this thing as one who is guilty in that the king does not bring his banished one home again. She essentially says, if you agree with me, why are you yourself operating in this manner? Absalom is as good as dead and there is no rightful error to the throne. Verse 14, for we will surely die and become like water spilled on the ground which cannot be gathered up again. She speaks to the simplicity of life that we all have an expiration and once it's over, it's over. Once the life is taken, it can't be brought back. She might even be referencing Amnon and saying, you can't bring Amnon back. Like, what are you going to do? If you kill Absalom, you can't bring him back. Then she goes on to say, yet God does not take away life, but he devises means that his banished ones are not expelled from him. The idea here is that it's not God's desire immediately to take life. He would first try to find a way to restore much like what we see in the New Testament where it says, he does not desire that any should perish. In this moment, this woman delivers a piercing truth about God to David. It's a truth that David himself knew dearly. You ever hear somebody talk about God and they say something about him and you're like, yeah, that's true. And if you know it's true because you sat with the Lord and he told this truth to you as well. And you're like, that's my God. Yeah, we know the same person. What you just said is true. I remember this happened for me. It was after Charlie Kirk's murder, we had a service and Pastor Frank is teaching. And maybe some of you remember this, you might have been here. And one of the things that Pastor Frank said, as soon as he said this, it was like the air left the room. Everybody's like gasped. But what he said was so God's heart, it wasn't even funny. He said, we need to forgive the man who murdered Charlie Kirk. And none of us want to do that, right? Our flesh is like, no, no, no. Yes, justice still needs to be served. He said that as well, but we need to forgive the man. But when he said that our spirits were like, yeah, because every single person in the room knew that's God's heart. We've been forgiven, right? We've experienced that. We know that's God's heart. And I can't help but wonder if, as she says this, as she talks about how God devises means to bring banished ones back to him so that they're not expelled and left his exiles, I can't help but wonder as David is hearing this, as he goes, he starts reflecting his own life and he goes, yep, that's true. That's true. And you want to know how I know he was banished. He was in exile. He says in Psalm 51 11, it says, David prayed this, do not cast me away from your presence. The idea is do not banish me from your presence and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. There is no doubt that David himself at one point had felt banished by God. And not only that, but it was for the same exact reason as Absalom. David literally plotted the murder of another man. In fact, it was worse because he took his wife as well. Yet God forgave him. Now perhaps we shift our focus from David's life and now we consider this truth in light of our own lives. For we too were once enemies of God and he made a way for us to return home. We were banished. We were exiles. And as we know, God provides exits for exiles. Where would we be if it weren't for him? Where would you be? I know where I would be. I certainly would not be standing right here. I would be in a dark, dark place. Where would you be? You know where you were before you met him. It was hopeless. You were just like, why am I even living? It was empty, dissatisfied. Maybe in some really dark places. I used to think this, if God is real, surely he wouldn't want anything to do with me. And yet he died for me. He made a way for me and he made a way for you. In his loving nature, he devised a plan to bring us back to himself that we should no longer be at enmity with God. But now we have experienced reconciliation. As Romans five would say, for we were once enemies of God, but we have been reconciled to him through the death of his son. Yeah, what she's saying resonates with us as well. And you know the crazy part about all of this, even in the midst of the story and the depravity of everything. The very thing she is saying right here is the very thing that is happening through the life of David. Let me tell you what I mean. We can see clear from this side of the cross that God through the life of David was still devising a plan to bring the seat of Christ. In the midst of this story, we are reading right here and now, God, as Romans eight would say, is working things together for good. Everything is going wrong yet somehow God is still intertwined in this. His fingerprint is still in it. And the seat of Christ comes from David. The life of Christ comes from David. Even the worst seasons of life are God uses for good. And this begs the question, what are you in the middle of right now that though it may be difficult, though you may have failed like David or maybe you haven't even failed. Maybe you're just in a situation you didn't sign up for. God is somehow some way working it together for good. Have you considered that? Have you considered that what you're walking through? God could still be using for good. It's hard to do that when you're in the middle of it, but we should consider it. It'll give us hope. You may go, well, you don't understand. You don't understand what I've done. I've messed up. There's no possible way. My whole life is just not the same. I'm in a dark spot or you might go, I didn't even do anything wrong, but everything's going wrong. To that, I would respond. I bet David felt the same way. And the life of David produced a greater good than I think David could have ever imagined. For it was through David that we received Christ. Do you know how many guys I have seen go through, far in 58, Renew, and how many women I have seen go through, women's Renew, that everything, they're in this situation where they've made a mistake and everything's gone wrong. And they're in the worst place of their life, the worst season of their life. And God takes it and He brings beauty from the ashes. In fact, I have been blown away at how many of them have been sitting in this room and I've been teaching. Every single time I'm like locking eyes with some of them. And I know them because I've been here 13 years. And so I've seen them. I've seen them go in and I've seen them come out. And then I see them sitting with their wives. And I'm like, oh my gosh, look what God has done. And I see them restored. I see them convicted. And I see them walking in the power of the Holy Spirit. And I see them changed. God will take our worst seasons. He will take the hardest things that we're going through. And He will turn it. He'll use it for His good. I'm so grateful for the worst season of my life. If it wasn't for the worst season of my life, I wouldn't know Jesus. Verse 15, Now therefore I have come to speak of this thing to my Lord, the King, because the people have made me afraid. And your maid servant said, I will now speak to the King. It may be that the King will perform their quest of His maid servant. For the King will hear and deliver His maid servant from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together from the inherits of God. Verse 17, Your maid servant said, the word of my Lord, the King will now be comforting for as the angel of God, so is my Lord, the King, and discerning good and evil. And may the Lord, your God be with you. She concludes with compliments. The best way to end a conversation after you just hoodwinked somebody is just compliment them. Just compliment them and then run, right? Verse 18, Then the King answered and said to the woman, please do not hide from me anything that I ask you. And the woman said, please let my Lord the King speak. And so the King said, he's clueless. Is the hand of Joab with you in all of this? And the woman answered and said, as you live my Lord, the King, no one can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my Lord the King has spoken. For your servant, Joab commanded me and he put all of these words in my mouth of your maid servant. Verse 20, To bring about this change of affairs, your servant, Joab has done this thing. But my Lord is wise according to the wisdom of the angel of God to know everything that is in the earth. And the King said to Joab, all right, I've granted, I don't think I've ever heard the word all right in the Bible. All right. He's like, all right. I have granted this thing. Go therefore bring back the young man, Absalom. David Relance and says, Absalom can return home. Evidently, Joab must have been somewhere nearby because it's almost like he turned him. It's almost like Joab was by the door and he's just like, please let this work. David's like, all right, go get him. Verse 22, Then Joab fell to the ground on his face and bowed himself and thanked the King. And Joab said, today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my Lord, O King, and that the King has fulfilled the request of his servant. So Joab arose and went to Gashur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. And the King said, let him return to his own house, but do not let him see my face. And so Absalom returned to his own house, but did not see the King's face. And so Absalom is back, possibly on house arrest. It says that they didn't see each other. So it kind of makes you wonder, like, how did they not run into each other at Whole Foods? You know, like, hey, like we need to talk. No, it didn't happen. So he might, he might have even been on house arrest. And now we get some insight right here, verse 25, and into who Absalom was. It'd be good to pay attention because you're going to learn a lot about Absalom next week. You're going to see a lot of him. Verse 25, now in all of Israel, there's no one who has praised as much as Absalom for his good looks. From the soul of his foot to the crown of his head, there was no blemish in him. It kind of reminds you of another King's Saul. And I would say Absalom wasn't so different from Saul. Verse 26, and when he cut the hair of his head at the end of every year, he cut it because it was heavy on him. And when he cut it, he weighed the hair of his head at 200 checkles according to the King's standard. Now, if you're in here and you cut your hair every year and you weigh it, you might be a little weird. So you probably should stop doing that, right? This guy was conceded. I mean, this guy's like, that's some nice hair. I should weigh that. I should weigh that. And then I should tell some people about it. Like, let's spread the word. Evidently, his hair weighed like three to four pounds. I guess you had a lot of thick hair. But verse 27 says this, to Absalom, we're born three sons and one daughter whose name was Tamar. She was woman, a woman of beautiful appearance. He named his daughter after his sister. Verse 28, an Absalom dwelled two full years in Jerusalem, but did not see the King's face. So Absalom's come back. He's grown in popularity with the people, but after two years, he has not even seen his father, which in total would make it five years. Evidently, Absalom was tired of waiting. I just wonder the bitterness that started to grow in him. Verse 29, therefore, Absalom sent for Joab to send him to the King, but he would not come to him. And when he sent again the second time, he would not come. So he's calling him. He's like Joab. Joa, he's FaceTime and I'm calling him. Joa is just like block, block the number. Verse 30, so he said to a servant, see Joab's field is near mine. You know what's a great way to get people's attention? You just burn their field. You just go burn, you just go burn their property. And he has some barley over there. Go set it on fire. Go set it on fire. And Absalom's servant set the field on fire. Well, that got Joa's attention, right? Verse 31, then Joab arose and came to Absalom's house and said, why did you set my field on fire? Like, I just imagined Joa being like, bro, that was like a lot of money. Also, I imagined him being like, I got you back in the kingdom and now you burned my field. Like, are you kidding me? Verse 32, an Absalom answered, Joab, look, I sent to you saying, come here so that I may send you to the king to say, why have I come from Gassuri? It would be better for me to still be there. Now, therefore, let me see the king's face. But if there is iniquity in me, let him execute me. Yes, David's son had returned. However, I would submit to you that Absalom's actions displayed that his heart was not truly repentant. This son was full of pride. Unlike the other son, the other story of a returning son that we may all be most familiar with, the prodigal son. These are not the same. This was an act of aggression by Absalom to force Joab to act on his behalf with David his father. And it reveals that Absalom's heart was not repentant or submissive, but manipulative. He wanted an ultimatum delivered to David, except me or kill me. He goes on to say, if there's iniquity in me, let him execute me, signifying that he had no remorse for his sin. Like he didn't think he did anything wrong. Of course, next week, the wickedness of his heart will be on full display as we see he tries to overthrow David's kingdom. Verse 33, this is our final verse. So Joab went to the king and told him, and when he called for Absalom, he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king, then the king kissed Absalom. After five years, David finally sees his son again. And in this moment, he chooses to offer him mercy. At the end of it all, here's the question. Did David make the right decision here? Some would say no, Absalom was not truly repentant and David should not have allowed him back in. It's a tough call because both justice and mercy are characteristics of the heart of God. And if you see next week, you're going to be like, yeah, he definitely shouldn't have let him back. But the question is this, what does the moment call for? It's not what's right or right. It's like, what would the Lord want him to do? I personally believe that David made the right choice here regardless of the outcome. I believe David considered how God had loved him after speaking with the woman from Tacoma. She mentions that God doesn't banish us. He devise his plans to bring us back. David listens to what she says. Then he decides to bring him back. I just believe he was sitting there. He's like, God did it for me. Who am I? Who am I to not do it for him? These are some of the things that make me believe he was making the right decision. And yes, no, David would show Absalom mercy. Absalom would ultimately turn on him. But this reminds me of another story where there was a man who came to show mercy to some undeserving people, yet was nailed to a cross by the ones he offered mercy to. It may be that some of the heart of God was still in David. Now, David was no Jesus, especially in the season of his life. And truth be told, he did not navigate this situation well, no matter what way you look at it. That being said, let us not forget the things we have learned from his mistakes. And so if you're taking note, I've got six quick points for you. First one, what we so will grow. What we so will grow, God will not be mocked if you consider this truth. It may save you from some bad seeds. When that website pops up on your phone or the explorer page looks like this, or you get a text message from an old friend, maybe you consider what I so will grow. It's not worth it. It's never worth it. Sin never satisfies it leads you empty. There's a way that seems right to a man, but it ends in destruction. Your next one is sin always has collateral damage. It costs David more than he could have ever imagined. It was his family. Guys, there's nothing more valuable than that. Other than our relationship with the Lord, there's nothing more valuable than your family. He lost the greatest thing he could have ever had. It has collateral damage. Sin stunts the process of sanctification. You'll never be truly who God has called you to be if you're stuck in sin. If you're in here and you're stuck, we want to pull you out. The Holy Spirit wants to pull you out. And so if you've been in this thing where it's like every day, there's shame, and then there's a few days where you start to feel better, and then there's more shame that comes. And it's just this constant cycle, and you can't ever progress in your relationship with Christ. If that's you, you don't need to be stuck. Who the Sun sets free is free indeed, where the Spirit of the Lord is. If there's freedom, and maybe the Spirit of the Lord is stirring in you right now, maybe he's going, hey, get free. Get help. And so if you're in some quicksand and you're stuck, maybe you let some of us come around you and pull you out. Your next one is inquiring of the Lord as a lifelong necessity. I don't care what season it is. I went last night after this, after teaching, I went and looked at the stars, and I was like, yep, same God. Same God I used to look up at the stars at when I was 18. Same God now. Doesn't matter what season, doesn't matter whether you have 10 kids, doesn't matter whether you have no kids, doesn't matter whether you just built a house, doesn't matter whether you're living in a apartment, doesn't matter whether you're making a lot of money, doesn't matter whether you're poor, doesn't matter who the president is, doesn't matter what pandemic's going on, doesn't matter what's going on in choir of the Lord. I don't care what's going on. We have to inquire of the Lord. It's a lifelong necessity. It is the very thing that you were made to do. He created you for fellowship with him in the garden. We saw that. And he's always been trying to make a, he's always been devising a plan to make a way back to that. Don't neglect it. Don't miss it. God provides exits for exiles. We know that one well. Praise the Lord. Anybody thankful for that. Thank you, Jesus, that we are no longer enemies, but we have found reconciliation. We are one with him. And the last one is this, even in the worst seasons of life, our God. He uses them for good. And that is for somebody right now. That is for somebody. If you are in the worst season of your life right now, if you are in the hardest thing, this is the hardest thing you've ever dealt with. Trust me. Trust the Lord. Don't trust me. Trust his word. For he will take what the enemy intends for harm and he will use it for good. For he works all things together for good. According to those who love him and are called according to his purpose. Let's pray. Lord, we love you. We thank you for your word because you speak through it. You speak through it and it just got it. Your voice is everything to us. It resonates in our souls. It restores us. It strengthens us. It comforts us. It gives us a piece that doesn't make sense. God, it warns us. Lord, would we heed the warning? God, we thank you for what you're doing in our hearts right now. And God, we ask that you continue. We don't want to just inquire on Sunday morning. We want to inquire throughout this week. Even as we're about to worship, Lord, we want to meet with you. We don't just want to sing another song. We want to meet with our maker. And Lord, I just pray for the person who's wrestling. And they're wrestling alone. They're fighting alone. Lord, I pray that they would get free. Holy Spirit, would you meet them? You're able to free us. And then you keep us. And for the person who's in this place where it's just so hard, hardest season of their life. Maybe this message makes them consider that you see, you know, you care, and you will work all things together for good. So we love you, Lord, and we ask that you come now as we draw near. We ask that you would hear our praise and hear our worship. And we pray this in the name of Jesus, amen."

In the meantime, grab your Bible and enjoy the teaching. Alright, so some years ago, thank you, we're ready to go. Yeah, I'm not the leader by the way, I'm brand new, I'm new here so I don't know what I'm doing. It's just never done this before. Yeah, some years ago, it's about four or five years ago, I think I remember the context, but it was it was just impressed upon my heart. I guess as a pastor who realized this as I looked out, the only one who knows what's coming this year in your life of my life is God. And I was sort of hit with this fresh again. Last Sunday as young Jesse was preaching, I was doing a funeral for just one of my dear, dear friends and one of my few fans and when you've got a few fans, you don't like to seem leave, right? You know, they're going off to heaven. A real, a precious 84-year-old Janice Boydston and this was her service and she would get up at the end of every service and she'd pop her head in and she'd give me a grade. She was a lifetime educator. She'd let me know how I did at the end of the message and I'll miss that forever. I was away with my family right after Christmas and I got a text from her son, Mama's home, she's, I'm like, we just spoke before I left. Sitting in her wheelchair, if she told me once, she told me a hundred times, pastor Frank, I don't know why the Lord just doesn't hurry up and take me home. I don't know how he gets he did, you know. She's sitting there, they found her and she was, she was home. And it just kind of, it just once again reiterates the fact that this thing that we, this life that we live is this is the frail, this is the, this is the place where bodies break down, this is the place where marriages can fall apart, this is the place where our dreams can be shattered. This is where it goes, this is where, thank God it's the short leg of the race, right? Thank God that this is the short leg of the race and what's ahead as eternal. But if, if you wouldn't mind, just sort of, and we've done this for the last, I think four years, this might be our fifth year. Just a show of sort of outward public humble, you know, submission to God. We might start the service with our hands in the air, just sort of as an act of surrender saying, I don't know what's coming, God, I have no idea what's coming and I know that this life could, it can just be a phone call and our entire year can start not the way we wanted it to start, right? We can be gripped with, we can be taken, we're on a mountain top right now, we can be in the darkest valley tomorrow. So I just felt led to start the service as it's been my habit first time in the the new year with our hands up in the air. Now if you're Presbyterian and you're like, do I, I'm not, I don't know, I don't know what comes next when you take your hands up. You could just put your hand just so he sees, just maybe in your lap even, even just turn your hand ever so open so that you are never associated with the Pentecostals. But maybe we just start as with a demonstration of like, Lord, I could you just be merciful to me, I'm so frail, you see what's around the corner I don't, prepare me even now for what it is that's coming and maybe even, maybe even, you know, go ahead and navigate some of those things that might otherwise just crush us. So if you feel comfortable with that, let's just start the year that way. Father in heaven, we lift our hands to you just as a symbolic gesture that we are so needy. We are not wise, you alone are wise. We're weak at the strongest of us compared to you are profoundly frail. You're a rock. We're nothing like that like sand we can shift and change. You never change. We don't see what's coming. We have no idea what's coming. And on the one hand that that can be a bit unsettling. And we don't, we're not called to live in fear but in faith. So we just pause right now with our hands up to you Almighty God, omniscient God, omnipotent God and ask that you'd be merciful with our frail, frail frame and our nature continue to be patient with us. Can and pour out mercy and grace upon us and will give you all the glory for a great year. We bless you, we trust you, speak to us now, your sons and daughters and all God's people say, amen, amen. Okay, so here we are. If you're joining us for the first time, we are glad that you're here with us. You're jumping into sort of the tail end of an epic saga. We've been studying essentially Israel's history in the old covenant or in the old, the original text. First and second Samuel or one book. We have broken it up into two. We did a series through first Samuel titled One Nation Under God and we titled the second series, Die Kingdom Come. And for Israel, it ultimately had. That is God had his man, David, on the throne ultimately and Israel got a chance to see once again because they had seen what it was like to be led by God under the prophet Samuel. And so God's kingdom had come and he's got his man in place and I can hardly think of a more comprehensive study of one man's life as it pertains to well what we face in life and leadership and godliness and what we learned from this little shepherd boy who God made king. Now you may have remembered that I noted that the first 10 chapters of second Samuel we get a chance to watch David prosper. Starting in chapter 11 we see David deal with all kinds of problems problems that he brought on himself problems that are personal problems that are within the context of his own family problems that begin to happen in the nation and the chapter we're about to read is a painful combination of all of that. But what's here before us is perhaps a special application or provides a special application to those who are in leadership especially spiritual leadership. So in a sense the spotlight comes upon me and us those who lead here at Cabri Chapel Chattanooga in a unique way. This is a passage that sort of highlights that in a unique way. However, it also applies to everyone who's ever had to had to or chosen to sit under the leadership in a spiritual context like and that's that then applies to every single one of us. And so I've titled this message the rebellious son and his repentant father. Now don't check out on me when I tell you what I'm getting right inside here right now but I've divided these 37 verses into 10 little vignettes. Okay? I'm gonna sort of spit out the little vignettes to you and at bare minimum at least you know you need to get to five, we're halfway through it. You're like we're getting close to the end like praise God. All right. So we're gonna learn about the rebel. We're gonna learn about the rebels methodology. We're gonna learn about the origin of rebellion. We're gonna learn about the atmosphere of rebellion. We're gonna see rebellion uncovered. We're gonna see a kingly response to rebellion. When the fallen repentant and forgiven face rebellion that's David fallen repentant forgiven. He's gonna face a rebellion. We're gonna see the way of the repentant or the way of the forgiven. How they function, how they act. The way of repentance tested. So when there's real repentance it's gonna be tested and finally we're gonna see God's remedy to rebellion to so here we go. Second Samuel 151. We're gonna meet our rebel here he is. After this it happened that Absalom provided himself with chariots and horses and 50 men to run before him. Every rebellion's got a rebel right led by a rebel and here he is. We know that he's Absalom David's son. He is now a murderer of one of his own brothers. Another one of David's son has perverted brother Amnon. This Absalom will be Israel's third king and he will if possible he's gonna largely make Israel's first king look saintly if that's if you can imagine. When we meet Absalom we meet a king after an entirely different order. We've talked about this there are leaders in the order of Saul and their leaders after the heart and the nature of David but Absalom is an entirely different we might say monstral together. We've Saul. Remember Saul was the people's choice. He was chosen by the people. God permitted it and God provided for him but we watched with Saul that power power he didn't ask for. Turned out to be way too much for him to handle and it we watched him just disintegrate and then we've got David. David is almost altogether unlike Saul. He was chosen by God and not the people. He was anointed by God. He was prepared by God one of the distinct differences between those who lead in the spirit of Saul those who lead in the spirit of David. Saul's are never really prepared. David's are we went we watched David really be prepared for the role. God provided for him like Saul though David never asked for power never sought it but God gave it to him and he wielded it masterfully until he did and that's why we're in the chapters that we're in right now but then we come to Absalom. He will be Israel's third king. He's a king of an entirely different sort not chosen by the people not chosen by God not permitted by God not provided for by God. He is a perfectly self-driven self-centered self-appointed self-annoyant and self-oriented perhaps the entirety of his life could be summed up in the little phrase that we just sort of breeze right by there in verse one. He provided himself with X and such. This would be the fullest iteration of self. Israel had ever faced in a king. He's the perfect antithesis of his father David. God provided everything for David. This guy's got to provide everything for himself you can see. David rose to power by true self deflection and restraint and this young man will pursue power by pure self assertion. So there he is. Now let's take a look at his methodology how he worked. Look at verse two. So he would rise early and he would stand beside the way to the gate so it was when everyone had or anyone had any lawsuit. He'd come to the king for decision that Absalom would say he'd call to him and say hey where are you from? He'd say your servant is from such and such a tribe of Israel then Absalom would look at him and say hey your case is good and right but let me point out a problem that you've never seen before. There's no deputy of the king to hear you. Moreover Absalom would say oh that I were made judge in the land and everyone who had any suit or cause would come to me and I would give him justice. And so it was when anyone came near to bow down to him that he would put out his hand and take him and kiss him in this manner. Absalom acted toward all Israel who came to the king for judgment and here's the line so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel. Every kingdom on earth, every institution on earth, every organization on earth the church included has its problems. The Absalums of this world are those who love to come along and show you problems that you didn't know exist. They want to focus on you know all of the frailty that you weren't even thinking about. You've got a good case there. Have you noticed? No I actually haven't but I'm pretty sure you're getting ready to help me see just how great things would be if I had you in my life. This is how he functions. Now he's the king's son right so people look on and go well here's a guy on the inside surely he's a reliable source. He puts himself where he doesn't belong and by flattery he steals those that we might say David had to absolutely suffer and labor to have. For self he stole what David worked for. It's interesting to me but Absalums of this world they never they're never big enough that they claim to be basically the answer to every problem on the planet. They never seem big enough to go out on their own and start something on their own and risk their own resources and their own time and their own sweat equity and their own energy. They'll never suffer anything like that. They just they'll stay around organizations where they can pick off the hard work and the labor of others. That's your Absalom. That's him. So he's got 50 horses. Well he's got 50 men. He's got horses and chariots and he buy that right everywhere he goes. He's his social media campaign. Like look at me look at me look at me like me like me like me I'm somebody I'm somebody I'm somebody so everywhere he went people like well who who who like he kind of showed up in the wake of this movement of a bunch of people and horses and chariots like gotta be somebody. He would make him self somebody which is not only the opposite of his father it's the opposite of the great as King who's ever lived King Jesus right. Philippians 2 says that Christ made himself of no reputation the foot soldiers of Jesus were 12 dudes that you wouldn't have picked for your kickball team right the disciples we're like these are your guys yeah these are my boys holy cow wow we wouldn't pick them yeah okay so there's the there's sort of the way he functioned now let's consider the launching the the origin of the rebellion that's coming and I would I'd put is it is it hebron or hell verse 7 now it came to pass after 40 years by the way that's like 40 years is likely an unfortunate translation it either means that Absalom was 40 when he did this or as other early early scholars like Josephus believe it's it meant it should be four listen this King David did not tolerate Absalom going to the city gate for 40 years in doing this so it's an unfortunate translation likely four years of this coup slow subtle purking coup under the under the surface he comes to his dad David and he says let me go to hebron and pray excuse me pay the vow which I made to the Lord for your servant took a vow while I dwelt at Gassure in Syria saying if the Lord indeed brings me back to Jerusalem then I will serve the Lord and the king said go in peace so he arose and he went to hebron okay this is going to be the place that he just strategically decides he wants to launch his rebellion against his father hebron and you've got to understand that he hebron wasn't was not simply to this isn't simply a practical place to stage the coup and the rebellion this was meant to hurt David this was meant to this was meant to more than her David this was meant to like ravish David's heart because the first group of Israelites who chose to believe in David and follow David and accept David as king were those from hebron remember he rained in hebron for seven years before all the other tribes ultimately came and accepted him so this is meant to say like the people that first chose you now choose me and you're on the outs it's meant to it's meant to be more than he means by this to really really hurt his father as much as possible along the way again hebron was personal to David they were the first to accept him anybody remember the words that Samuel spoke to King Saul Israel's first king in the moment that God refused him as king I'll give him to you he says this for rebellion and that's what we're watching Samuel said to Saul rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft meaning it's demonic so the origin of this rebellion wasn't really hebron I'd submit but hell indeed and hell isn't interested in simply hurting spiritual leaders hell wants to utterly pulverize their hearts this is just happy news for anybody here who's like I'd love to be in church leadership yay you know it's like you might as well put a you might as well just tattoo a target on your forehead or your back or something and notify hell come hurt me as hard as you can it's essentially what is happening here so now let's now let's sort of wait into the atmosphere of rebellion verse 10 well Absalom he sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel saying as soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet then you're going to scream or you're going to say Absalom reigns in hebron and with Absalom went I'd love these guys 200 men invited from Jerusalem and they went along innocently and did not know anything then Absalom sent for a hithofel the Gila night David's counselor from his city from Gila while he offered sacrifices and the conspiracy grew strong for the people with Absalom continually increased in number Absalom has been stealing the hearts of we might say David's people by flattery and constantly and critically pointing out all the flaws of the kingdom that you know beyond the obvious everybody knows that David's been in the midst of a rough patch and then with what it is that their minds and their ears have heard now for like for four years they start to see something of a crowd right there's momentum most of we're not the only ones who feel this way and it's it's 50 men and then it's 200 men and now the conspiracy is growing stronger and there's going to be a trumpet blast the trumpet blast in Israel this is not something that we culturally have any understanding of maybe the most maybe maybe the most like it and it's so distant in our cultural history but would be the church bells that would ring right it was like calling people to worship or in some cases the the the trumpet blast in Israel was was meant to call you it was meant to awaken you and arouse you like you're either going it's we might have to fight right now uh this would be physiologically akin to a massive panic attack I wish I knew nothing about panic attacks but I do where on the broad in the midst of a panic attack because gods made our bodies with this supernatural capacity to infuse ourselves with adrenaline when we need to fight or when we need to flut flee right it's a powerful thing it's why you hear of these stories and people in the midst of they're just sort of infused with supernatural strength to do amazing things well panic physiologically speaking is when there is no reason to flee or fight and all of a sudden your body out of whack begins to score with adrenaline and now you're you're sitting there could be in a church service could be anywhere and it happens through all kinds of factors but and all of a sudden you're thinking yourself dear I mean the room I won't describe any longer because I'm like just stop I'm about ready to have a panic attack right now so what I'm trying to say is this environment is not emotionally neutral it's not peaceful this is anxious this is tense this is uncomfortable and then you've got these 200 used felidias who have no idea what's going on where are you going I don't know who you following I don't know what are you doing and there there's always a group that has no idea what is that they're involved they're involved in something so dark but they're just you just following along the sad now check this out and then Absalom knows he knows all he needs now is one good and I mean a really good former disgruntled employee and it's on baby and he's got to hit the fell and if it hit the fell he happens to be bashed his granddaddy who he's on the ends and he happens to be we're going to find out here in a minute he happens to be one of David's closest most trusted he's going to call him my best friend you feel how like this feel this this is like up this is a he says it in Psalm 41 even my best friend the one I trust it completely the one I shared my food has turned against me it's it's a toxic it had mixture of secrecy slander in you windows betrayal bitterness and anxiety not listen the Absaloms though they claim to be the real moral champions right they take the moral high ground they're really the spiritually superior one of my observations throughout the years and I wish I had no experience with this but I do is that those who take the high ground spiritually and try to take down those in spiritual leadership or replace those in spiritual leadership or discredit those in spiritual leadership they never do so in a godly way like they're so godly but their methods are always entirely ungodly and you go wait wait a second wait you're the righteous ones so now God sees to it I'd submit to you that the rebellion is made known to David his rebellion exposed in one verse now messenger came to David saying king the hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom David you see with all of his historic and epic failure and flaws is still God's man and so because he was still God's man God made sure that he knew what was going on he came and he let's him know what's happening that maybe just natural because that's a hard thing to sort of keep wraps on loose lips sing ships but because this rebellion in the end isn't of hebronish origin that really wasn't the origin of this but health I think God chooses to involve himself and he wants to make sure that his leader that he called is aware of what's going on see one of the things that as we watched Saul make David an enemy one of the things that Saul never got his mind around and one of the things that Absalom has completely underestimated he thinks he's going to war against his daddy who he's determined is an unworthy leader he's not going to war against his daddy he's going to war against God and he you know like this isn't going to work my friend he's convinced it will so God involves himself God makes David with all of his flaws and all of his faults so still God's man so God lets him know so now that he knows notice his kingly response to rebellion so David said to all his servants who are with him a Jerusalem arise we've got to flee or we shall not escape from Absalom may case to depart let's the overtake us suddenly and bring disaster upon us and strike the city with the edge of the sword and the king's servant said to the king where your servants ready to do whatever my Lord the king commands then the king went out with all of his household after him but the king left 10 women concovines to keep the house and the king went out with all the people after him we're told that twice that is we see David leading again he's the shepherd of Israel he's leading them he's not behind them or in the middle of them so he can be protected he's out front of all of them and as he gets to the outskirts of the city he stops verse 18 and then all of his servants passed by and the chair of thights and the pellet thights and the githights and the 600 men who had followed him from gath passed before the king I would submit to you this is a wise response a very wise response I'd submit to you this isn't this is a seasoned response this is a man who fully understands war battles strategy this is a shepherd's response as I just pointed out come back to that a very very humble reason this isn't this isn't David in the later stages of his life and he's now just become a passive wimp no no no this is this is humble this is this is the David that always left matters in the gods hands he's not going to go you little come on come on kid this is a selfless response it's a very open-handed response and notice we're told about that group of men remember when David was on the run from Saul you can imagine all those years he's thinking this is a strange way to become king I've been I've been running around for 13 years out in the wilderness from this weirdo that's got a spear in his hand and remember at one point all these men come and they gathered to David remember who they were just like the disciples they were all the disgruntled all the indebted all of the the rejects of society everyone that nobody they all came to David and they all became David's mighty men like they became giant slayer some of them themselves well these guys look on and they're like listen they hadn't forgotten all the good that had come to them and their families following this ordinary shepherd man god made king it reminds me of the time that Jesus spoke to the self-righteous Pharisee Pharisees and his midst there was a moment towards the ends of his life when a woman who had a very shady past came before Christ and she lavished his profound gift upon Jesus right she takes her full dowry she begins to anoint Christ his feet wipes her wipes his feet with her hair and the Pharisees they look on and like clearly he's not a prophet as she's a dirty dirty girl and he turns to them knowing what's in their hearts and he says I tell you her sense and they are many have been forgiven so she's shown me much love but a person who's forgiven little shows only a little love and vernacular they were far more familiar with he who's been forgiven much love's much and so these indebted ones look on they're like you know for all of his faults he took us and so now that he's being rejected like we once were we're gonna take him we choose him we're staying and listen couldn't we say that in a certain sense David has now become like one of them in a whole new way like these were men who had made a mess of their lives these are men who were in debt because they made made really really really bad choices they were the outcasts because of their own choosing and David is now kind of like he's with him he's one of them it's like the fellowship of the fallen this group those the the the the the guilty but forgiven ones they sort of stuck together there's a great it anyone familiar with gene edwards little book the tale of three kings it's a fantastic little read oh almost none of you it's you can read it quickly I read it on Friday I read it many years ago and it's it's a story of these three kings just a little King David King Saul in this absalom and there's an exchange in the book where David is informed of his seditious sons and tensions and the servant looks at David he's like what are you gonna do with this with this malevolent what are you gonna do with this ungodly what are you gonna do with this rebellion and he and he looks to the to the servant he goes well I'm not going to become a Saul now but basically I'm gonna live at the end of my life the very same way I lived at the beginning of my life and I'm not gonna take matters into my own hands I didn't I was I didn't ask for this throne I didn't ask for this role I didn't ask to be king and the god god promised it to me and he put me there and if he sees fit to take me out of here then that's his business but I'm not going to get involved in trying to hold on to something the god might say you're done I'm not gonna do it it's very it's profound that's why I say this next section here and and and marks I would submit you and it's it's good for us to see because it hasn't been fun to watch Dave the last two weeks right this is King David he's gone passive because of his son he's got all kinds of the deepest problems in his own family and you're like where's our David like where is he well you're starting to see him now you're starting to see him now sort of come out of the what the hibernation of his own failure and he's starting to be the David that we all know and love again it's his this is repentance and he's heading in the right direction and so notice this is a seventh little vignette verse 19 when the fall and repentant and the forgiven that's David faces rebellion what do they do well then the king said to it tied the get tight but by the way what just happened was David hears that his own son is going to take the throne he's going to usurp he it's a coup it's a military political coup he's gonna remove his dad he's gonna usurp his father and so he looks to a serpents he goes we better flee now and and he leads his people to the outskirts of the city it's wise he looks on he's like I've already got bloodshed I've already got blood on my hands that I'm responsible for the last thing I wanted to stay here and fight and let them bring the sword and there'll be a whole much more this whole thing is a because of me and it's about me it's not about them so he's like we got to get away from all the people so we can minimize the pain to others as much as possible it's very selfless so he leads everybody and these stops and everybody's passing by and then the bible takes the time to tell us of his dialogue with one guy he looks on there's 600 people that have passed by and he sees one guy here it's actually more than that because the wife and the kids and and he looks at one guy and he picks him out he's like what are you doing here and like the bible stops to go he they tell us about this exchange between David and one guy which I'll just cheat now before we read the rest and say this is so entirely unlike Absalom Absalom is doing everything he can to get people follow me follow me be mine be under my wing come be one of my followers right I want you to be with me not for them but for himself here David when he could use somebody comes to a guy and he's like you don't need to be with me but why are you what are you doing read how it goes he says why are you also going return a remain with the king for your foreigner and also an exile from your own place in fact you got here yesterday you came yesterday you haven't even been a part of the team you came yesterday should I make you wander up and down with us today since I go I know not where I have not we have no idea we're going return and take your brother and back mercy and truthy with you but it's I answered the king and said as the Lord lives and as my Lord the king lives surely in whatever place my Lord the king shall be whether in death or life even there your servant will be so David said it's high okay we'll go and cross over then it's time to get tight with all of his men and all of his little ones who are with him crossed over and all the country wept with a loud voice and all the people crossed over the king himself crossed over the brick kid running all the people crossed over toward the way of the wilderness I mentioned David's shepherdly response he leads the people out we get this interaction with one man and to me I would submit to you this is the kindness of God to the repentant listen just because David failed and we might say that he failed quite literally no pun intended or pun intended royally epically publicly and would face and is facing right now the consequences of what it is that he did listen that did not mean that God was no longer for David God was still for David and I would submit you this is evidence of this that is abslom has to do everything he can to provide for himself David's not asking for anyone to follow him and God's like I'm not only going to give you people I'm going to give you people like that that will stick with you death or life right it's beautiful it's like I'm going to even know you've sinned and you've sinned publicly and you have made a mess of things your repentant you're forgiven and I haven't given up on you I'm still for you and I'm going to show it to you in kindness in the middle of your in the middle of your difficulty it's amazing notice how real repentant men function listen what comes out of his mouth well at the end of the line there's Zadok he's one of the priests and all the Levites they were bearing the Ark in the covenant of God and they set down the Ark of the covenant and Ab8 are another priest went up until all the people had finished crossing over from the city well then the king said to Zadok carry the Ark of God back into the city and if I find favor in the eyes of the Lord he will bring me back and show me both it and his dwelling place but if he says thus I have no delight in you here I am let him God due to me as seems good to him the king also said does that act the priest are you not a seer returned to the city in peace and your two sons him it has your son Jonathan the son of Ab8 are see I will wait in the plans of the wilderness until word comes from you to me to inform me therefore Zadok and Ab8 are carried the Ark of God back to Jerusalem and they remained there again what we're watching here folks is genuine repentance in action Paul wrote to the Corinthians to distinguish the difference between two kinds of sorrow when we humans get it wrong when we sin there's something called worldly sorrow and there's something called godly sorrow he talks about that and then he unpacks just what this godly sorrow is it leads to real repentance he says in second Corinthians I've got it on the screen seven for observe this very thing that you sorrowed in a godly manner what diligence it produced in you like here's the fruit of real repentance what clearing of yourselves what indignation what fear what vehement desire what zeal what vindication I want to focus quickly just on two of those aspects the clearing of yourselves and fear together see David knew that he was king because god called him god had a place god has a god had a role that he designed David to fulfill and god had a specific place that the ark was meant to be in Jerusalem that capital city and in the very holy of holies in the tabernacle later later the temple but David realizes that he may never have the chance because of his sin and for his sin he may never have the chance to be back to that place his role as king and he may never see that ark and never see that city ever again you see real repentance leaves all that comes next into god's hands god David wouldn't control the circumstances we might say to mitigate the cost he'd incur because of his sins in the case in the old fashioned case of spanking does anybody remember that as a kid yeah I mean I'm probably maybe one of the last generations well I we we we did that in my house so I mean don't send it to the the department of child services but I grew up in the 70s right and the 70s I think about belts from the 70s just think about that for a second okay and when I would get in trouble I knew that eminent pain was soon to follow I would wouldn't pray it was really wasn't religious in that sense but I did I did I did hope to god I had a little time enough time to get up to my room and get some more underpants on right and then I would hope to god that dad wouldn't pull my pants down because it didn't matter then see what I was trying to do is mitigate I was trying to mitigate the consequences of what it is that I did and I would so from time to time my dad would say son I'm gonna I'm gonna let you pick the belt this is 70s man and so at first I thought the little skinny white belt you know like when they all wore the white jumpsuit you know like 70s and the big I thought the little skinny white belt that's probably not as bad as the big belt with all the holes in it all the way down the big leather belt with the big scary and now he wouldn't use the buckle just FYI didn't use the buckle but I'm here to tell you a little skinny white belt that that that that that was a bad idea that that that didn't compute right little skinny thin yeah it was it was a great deterrent to sin and I tried maybe not all of them but I tried next the thick one that doesn't matter and it just doesn't matter and I you don't put you know you put your hands about you're doing everything you possibly can't omit to mitigate the consequences of what it is that you've done real repentance when repentance is real it doesn't control the consequences it trust God and accepts whatever comes no matter what so David's like listen I did the crime I'm not gonna keep the ark with me I'm not gonna fight this battle I may be like Saul completely removed from God's favor and I may never come back meaning I'm gonna say and what does he say I mean when we read these words carry the ark of God back into the city if I find favor in the eyes of the Lord he will bring me back and show me both it in his dwelling place but if he says this if God says I have no delight in that kid then here I am and let God do to me whatever he chooses to do to me that folks is real repentance I'm not gonna control the circumstances I'm not gonna try to mitigate the pain of what's coming because I did it you see it's real repentance now real repentance will be tested and here comes a test and this folks gets heavy so David went up by the ascend of the mount of all of us and he wept as he went had his head covered and he's barefoot and all the people who are with him covered their heads and they were weeping as well and here's where it got all it was crushing then someone told him a hithafel is among the conspirators with Absalom with Absalom and David said David said he prayed oh Lord I pray turn the council of a hithafel into foolishness this is David and his a hithafel listen the most the closest that I can try to paint this for you so you know how difficult this was is when Judas came up to Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane and betrayed him with a kiss like this is like no no no no no no no no listen number one that's that's one of my best friends this is one of my best friends who has turned his back on me number one and number two if you don't know when a hithafel spoke he spoke as the very oracles of God the dude was undefeated when it came to strategy and wisdom David's like oh God oh God this is bad this is the kind of stuff when you hear it it makes you almost want to vomit and drives David to his knees it's the first time we've seen David pray for how long now I need to highlight something here I could have started with it to sort of put this banner over all of it but here it is here's the thing I should have highlighted earlier so we try to make sense of what it is reading this is folks is heavy God will use the ungodly and their ungodliness as tools of our discipline listen and all the while he's never the author of the ungodly behavior okay this is a very interesting thing in fact I'll just let me parallel it this way in Israel's history in the end ultimately God called the god it God called he summoned the Babylonians and absolutely pagan godless culture to come and destroy and take captive Judah so Judah would learn their lesson to not be idolatrous now here's the heavy thing later on if you read the major prophets Isaiah Jeremiah when you read the major prophets God turns around later on down the road and he comes back to the Babylonians and he's like I you went way too far in doing what you your ungodliness bled out all over the place and now you're gonna pay for the way that you dealt with those people that's heavy right he wasn't the advocate of all of their ungodliness he was going to use them to train them and to teach them but here's the thing folks and this is why when men feel spiritually superior and they want to bring judgment upon another man who they deemed to be unworthy this is a son who looks at his father and he's completely unworthy men typically reach for a much bigger belt than God does you see and so what we're watching here we might say is and isn't God it is and it isn't divine in fact I'd submit to you that it crossed the line of discipline and went into the realm of the demonic now whether David understood this or not is a conversation for another time it would make the difference it would make a big difference in the midst of what he was facing but I don't know whether or not he understood that it really wasn't God but the devil and so David upon hearing of a hit the fells betrayal deeply wounded now maybe more concerned than ever about the coup he prays to God and so if you've been with us and you're now aware of just what David's guilty of we might ask the question now does God answer the prayers of men like David finally verse 10 the remedy for rebellion and God's remedy for this rebellion like this is a dark thing this is a dark coup it might surprise you how God chooses to remedy this now it happened when David had come to the top of the mountain where he worshiped God there was Hushai the archite coming to meeting with his robe torn and dust on his head this is the first time and far far too long that we've read about David the sweet it's almost of Israel worshipping God and I love this notice where he worshiped there was Hushai God's answer we might say to his biggest and the only recorded prayer presently there was a principle that we lifted from David's life in a previous it a previous previous sees you remember David got really weary running from Saul and at one point you said you know what I'll just go hang out with the Philistines and he did for 18 months he lived among the Philistines and we were watching David our king in a midst of a backslid in state well then he gets right with God remember we one of the points that we sort of we said let's get right with God when we get right with God and we get ready for providence and soon as David got right with God remember he started to meet these guys in the field and giving him the intel that he needed so here's David he's right with God and where he worships there just so happens to be Hushai now he'll have to forgive me Hushai he's in heaven now I just think he's a little person I'm like it's little Hushie it's it's little Hushai it's just a little guy I don't know why I think that yeah maybe it's because I don't know so look what David says to this guy who just shows up and I'm telling you now something that David doesn't know that little guy is literally the answer to the prayer he just prayed oh God I pray that you turn the council of a hits the fell into foolishness well Hushai shows up listen David says to him David says listen if you go with me it'll be a burden I'm gonna have to take care of you too but if you return to the city of Absalom and say to Absalom turn to the city and to the city and say to Absalom I'll be your servant O King as I was your father servant previously so I will now also be your servant then you may defeat the council of a hit the fell listen to me this is David versus Goliath all over again Hushai defeating the no one defeated the council of of a hit the fell he was undefeated when he spoke he spoke the very oracles of God he had a wisdom that was supernatural and divine you can imagine him going you me me my council defeat his council you might as well be asking for the sun to stop or something huge prayer and he says and do you not have Zadok that you're not going to be alone I'm not sending the lions then all by yourself you'll have Zadok and ABA through the priest there with you therefore it's going to be that whatever you hear from the king's house that you shall tell Zadok and ABA Thar they're they're they're going to tell their sons the two sons him it has in Jonathan and then by them those sons you'll send me everything that you hear so look at verse 37 so Hushai David's friend went into the city an Absalom came into Jerusalem I know I'm fast-forwarding and I'm sort of speeding ahead and giving you a bit of the I'm it's a spoiler alert but in the end David prays it's the one prayer that's recorded it's a huge prayer oh god I pray turn the council of a hit the fell into foolishness because if you don't we're done that's how wise he is he'll outstratigize me we're done and so this little man is ultimately going to be the answer the remedy to this dark rebellion but it's found there in the final verse that God's remedy we might say to this very very dark period in David's life and the history of the nation of Israel is found in that common and often overlooked and unappreciated simple word a friend just a friend David just needed right now while everyone was turning against him a friend in fact someone wants to describe to friend as the one that comes in when everybody else goes out that's Hushai okay and we're going to see just how massively he's used to remedy this really dark rebellion so what can we learn should have told you at the beginning that I was going to call on you by name for some feedback if you don't mind I would I would like to just take a few minutes and see if we can't unpack a little bit together what it is that we've learned if we did this last night it'd be fun to try it again here so if you feel comfortable we'll just we'll put it under a couple categories maybe just two I think we can probably only get with with Absalom and David but wrote what does a passage like this teach us from the life of Absalom what can we learn from Absalom in this passage if you're comfortable I know we can just we'll start to just sort of dialogue a bit here back and forth what do you see in Absalom's life pride absolutely we could at whoever said that pride comes before the fall and if you this this fall is going to be terrible pride comes before the fall what else did you say yeah self-centered right self-appointed put himself where he ought not be what else can we learn from Absalom say it again what revenge yeah remember God told all the world through the pan of Paul do not take vengeance vengeance his mind say it's the Lord this young man had already done that he looked at his father his father didn't do anything about what am not a done to Tamar and he decided he was going to he was going to go rogue justice and he slaughtered his own brother right now he's going to take revenge against his father what else can we learn from Absalom campaign like a dark campaign beware of dark campaigns I mean that's if I'm putting words in your mouth forgive me what else yeah right avoid dirty politics well good luck in our world right now that's that be tough that be a tough thing to do what I mean what else can we learn from his life pardon me he did well you know what he did have a lousy father but God didn't count David lousy then the end God's still called David a man after God's own art that's good in fact it's the only commandment that comes from God's top 10 right it's the only commandment that comes with a promise that you may live a long life Absalom won't because he just honored let me let me say this real quick well here here's one just simple sort of low hanging piece of fruit from Absalom you ready don't be one okay that's a good one don't be an Absalom number one number two don't listen to an Absalom don't listen to them okay but here is a mistake that the young man made that we're all we can all be prone to listen he looks at his father and listen his father his historically failed right he's got blood on his hands innocent blood on his hands he is an adulterer he's a murderer David has failed profoundly okay here's the failure that the young man made and we're all quick anyone here anyone in this room have a father just real quick yeah yeah anybody in the room have a father has ever made a mistake yeah your father make a mistake to the point that he's no longer he doesn't doesn't matter what he says he's the biggest fool on the planet now i'm not submitting there aren't fathers that are absolutely reprobate and there is there are fathers like this but so check this out listen this is so heavy when it comes to rising to power there i would submit to you there has never ever ever been another man that's done it better than David and he looked at his father and he's like you know what because of your failure because your passivity because of your sin because you wouldn't stand up and do it was right i'm going to take the sum totality of your life and i'm going to put it all in the negative column i don't want to hear a dagum thing out of your mouth you look on to go home boy the smartest thing you could have ever done is sat down with your father and said hey dad how do you get to the throne because the throne was coming for him but he he did what we often do we look at someone and we decide that the 30 or the 40 or the 50 years of their righteous life accounts for nothing and now we judge you because your humanity got the best of you we take you and go we just going to put the sum totality of who you are and the category of negative and i discount you all together that's a big mistake right that i mean listen that is a massive mistake on this young man's part this is going to cost him his life this is going to be a very very short reign it's not going to go it all the way he thinks it's going to go let's move to David for the sake of time this is so much fun we're going to stay till noon is that all right we'll we'll give everybody a free lunch we'll try to do this quickish real quick what can we learn from David i mean let's stay in the chapter because there's so much from all that has happened already what kinds of things might we learn from David repentance is one and i'm going to talk about that in just a second humility absolutely right yeah yeah god answers prayer he answers the prayers is set any other is there just am i the only one is there any other center in the room real quick just want to make sure he does answer the prayer of sinners now not sinners who regard and keep and continue to cherish and equity in their heart the psalmist said if i regard and equity in my heart if i just coddle it and i cherish it and i love it god won't hear our prayers but david david's done with that i mean if if anyone's sorry for what it is that the man did it's him and he's going to live the rest of his life he's going to live the rest of he's forgiven and he's god's man and after the fact god's still god he promises to david that from your line someone's going to sit on the throne forever and ever and ever and we just celebrated christmas that's Jesus right but it was this man david so repentance is beautiful humility is beautiful well anything else say it again stay connected to god even yeah you don't have to fail he reconnects with god this or another one here surrender absolutely which is yeah say it again yes yes he'll go before even those who have fallen yes he's he's he's he's letting david know what's going on he's providing good men for david abslams go to the all real quick i've been thinking about this one say it again he is he is a man after god's own heart which is something for us to take a long walk in the woods with because he was a failure to a large degree greater than many of us did you just aim in that all right i'm going to finish with this i'm see if i can finish with this because this is really important i've been thinking about this uh for some some weeks now and this is the the appropriate time to sort of unpack it the scripture tells us of a law whatever a man says that he will also reap right and it's on the one hand mortifying because if we're all honest with ourselves in this room some of us are planting seeds of unrighteousness that we don't we think aren't going to ever come to harvest no one sees god doesn't see god doesn't know it could be an attitude it could be whatever right that's that's scary because what do you say whatever it is that you sow that's what it uh uh pulse into the glaciens if you sow to the sinful nature when the harvest comes it's going to be destruction it's going to be it's going to be bad fruit right bad news good news is if we'll begin to sow seeds of righteousness we'll make wiser choices godly choices right that those same seeds are one day going to come and there'll be a harvest of righteousness okay is there anything that can stop that law pardon me say it again redemption well and before that the only thing that can stop that law is repentance meaning you plant the seed you plant the seed we could let me go to david's life remember I said in second Samuel 11 when david sent me the basheba that if he would have stopped at just being on the roof and lusting after her right remember he looked he lusted he googled her he searched found out who she was if he would have stopped there there would not have been at chapter 12 there were not at chapter 13 at chapter 14 all that could have stopped repentance folks listen repentance biblically is literally it's it's it's it's just turn the the unrighteous things that we think and we do and we look upon and we practice repentance in the end is nothing more it it it isn't simple it's supernatural is to turn and to walk away from those seeds of unrighteousness that's repentance meaning listen to me listen to me right now if you're hearing what I'm telling you and I'm preaching to myself the harvest of this year in your life and my life can be so entirely different if we will just before Jesus and with his help in the words of Bob Newhart that great counselor stop it just stop just stop whatever dark path you're on whatever dark pattern you're on stop it that is if you've planted the seed repentance is like reaching back down into the dirt pulling it out showing it to God for what it is God I'm so sorry I'm done and turn around and go the other way listen the harvest is not going to be a nightmare but a profound blessing right David has repented now he there are consequences and if he would have just Lord I looked at that woman I lusted to that woman I googled searched that woman I I I craw I mean I lusted after her I am guilty good pluck that out show it to God lights on it go forward no chapter 12 no chapter 13 everything from there is very very different amen this word repentance that we're scared of because we're afraid we're going to be found out is one of the most beautiful powerful words in all the human language because it has the capacity and it alone to disrupt a law that otherwise otherwise is undefeated amen now listen I didn't really think Marco did that great of a job this morning so we're not going to bring it back out again we'll from from here on out I've kept you till 10 30 it's way too late I love you I love you I'm proud of you I'm glad to be a part of this fellowship go have a happy holy righteous week amen"
32,069adbc6ddf560b6,9890,52311,en,whisper_local,base,v1.0,"2026-02-18 03:49:18","All right. Good morning. Good morning. Oh yeah, you guys lose. I can already tell you that second service on a bad day is going to beat you. And third service, I don't know lightly. That's Paul and Chad got it right. It's right right down the alley. Can you beat this for? All right. Well, Leviticus chapter 11. Let's go there. One quick announcement. And I want to just be somewhat brief about it. Actually, I'll talk about that in just a second. Let me just get past the announcement regarding the women's event or the women's study. That is tomorrow, ladies. It is not too late to sign up for that. We think that this is going to be a really good, really good study going through a really good subject. That's first and second Peter. You don't want to miss out on it. We've got a lot of studies lined up this time around. And Karen Johnson, I was just talking to her about this the other day. She's very excited about teaching through it. I think that it's just been one of those passages that has sort of encouraged her a lot. I know when I was teaching through first and second Peter, it was phenomenal. I mean, it's such a great passage in the Bible to go through. And I for one just absolutely love anything that's going to talk about end times. And you're going to spend any amount of time in that. You're going to spend a lot of time in it, especially when you get to second Peter. And it's very, very, very, very worthwhile. So, okay. So please sign up. If you signed up previously for the previous study, you're going to need to sign up again this time around. So I just thought it would be good to let you guys know. And then also, there's a lot of questions coming my way right now, especially about what is going to happen in Iran. And a lot of the talk about what's happening, especially with some of the recent movements, taking place in the Middle East and some of the policy statements being made, especially by, especially with the statement that the president just made pretty, pretty, pretty aggressive. Just be on the lookout this week. We're going to spend a lot of time analyzing that. There's a lot to talk about. And there's a lot on the horizon dealing with this. There's a lot of discussion happening back and forth. And so we're going to put in some real analysis into it this week for those of you guys that might be interested. This is going to be an interesting time for the people of Israel, especially if things happen the way I think they might. I keep telling David, I'm like, David, take, get back from Israel. You know, I mean, I know he lives there part of the time, but it's going to be an interesting time to see what happens to say the least. And we're going to provide some coverage regarding that and talk about the biblical precedent for it. I'll tell you this one thing. Okay. Anytime war breaks out anywhere in the Middle East, don't listen to the guys that says this is Ezekiel 38. Okay. It's a knot. You got to understand that. In order for Ezekiel 38 to even happen, you have to be in a condition of peace. There has to be peace all throughout to the point where Israel feels so confident about the peace that they have that they in essence remove their security around many of their cities. And that we're not we're absolutely not there. Okay. We're just not. So could that happen quickly? Certainly it could. But right now we're not there. And I don't I don't want the lies that oftentimes come up regarding what's happening based on people that don't know the whole truth with respect to what the Bible says to dramatically we influence how they interpret or how they see everything. And I think that that's kind of a dangerous sort of a dangerous place to be. So don't listen to a lot of that. That stuff is just generally wrong. Okay. Because the Bible gives us the formula and we have it and it's actually pretty clear. So with that, let's pray. Ask the Lord to go before us and we'll dig right in. Father heaven, we just thank you Lord for your word. We thank you for the opportunity that you've given us to dig deeply in your word Lord to understand and discern and know Lord what it is that you're saying. I just take a moment to pray that the words that I share would be your words Lord and not mine and that father you'd be glorified in and through what is said and what happens Lord. We also just pray God for insight and wisdom and discernment and understanding Lord that we would receive direction. And that we would be edified Lord based on the things that we're reading Lord even in a passage like this. There's so many that might read this and think it doesn't have a lot of value, but it certainly does. And we ask Lord that you would continue to inspire us Lord to understand it and to know exactly Lord what it is that you're communicating. So Lord, we just love you. We thank you Lord. We look to you and we ask these things now in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Okay. So we've been dealing with a lot so far as we've been going through the book of Leviticus and I got to tell you that there is a lot here that we just simply cannot ignore. I know that there is a tendency for people to just skimpast so much of what's being communicated here because they look at the Levitical Law as something that has no real application to them. When in reality it always has an application to us in virtually every way and on every level. And I think that sometimes the tendency to blow it off just comes from the fact that guys who teach through it tend to blow it off, right? They read through big sections of it and then basically say, yeah, but this is all testament stuff and really doesn't apply to us, but so much of it very much does apply to the point where there is so much application that you can draw from a passage like this that I find myself on a regular basis having to put some notes in front of me to keep me accountable to not chasing a bunch of rabbit trails. And this is one of these passages where it is very easy to chase a bunch of rabbit trails. Now you might look at me and say, well, James, how in the world can that be the case when you are talking about this section of the Levitical Law that talks about the animals to eat or the animals not to eat? You know, like how in the world would you actually run down a bunch of rabbit trails? Well, there's a lot of ways to do that, especially when it comes to the discussion of the specific animals and what they mean. Like, for example, we will get to a section where we talk about birds and we begin to see the significance of the fact that God places a prohibition on the consumption of predators or scavenger birds. There's a reason for that. And we'll talk about why that is so consequential and why it's so significant. And by the way, you don't have to spiritualize it. One bit is about, in fact, if you just look at it from a simply mechanical perspective and you're talking about it from a healthy perspective or a health perspective, then it makes all the difference in the world. And being the health expert that I am, this is a very, very valuable passage to me. So I just thought I would say that right off the bat. Actually, I kind of feel like a bit of a hypocrite when I talk about some of this stuff because there are some principles here that are so important. And don't get me wrong, listen. By the grace of God, and I was actually tempted to do this today, but I decided I wouldn't, because of the sake of the live streaming and all the implications there. By the grace of God, I have lost right around 350 pounds since the time that we actually started the church here. As a matter of fact, in our married couples dinner, I was showing some of these pictures to some of the people and they were like, wow, that is crazy. Like, we don't even recognize you in that photo, right? And it's funny because there's so much that goes into doing something like that. And there are so many lessons that you can learn from passages like Leviticus to sort of drive you in that direction. Now, I'm not there yet. I haven't really gotten to the point where someone looked at me and go, oh yeah, he's the epitome of health. That'll never be the case with me because I break all kinds of rules as it relates to my health. Perhaps the number one rule that I break on a regular basis is the sleep rule. As a matter of fact, I'm at the point where I'm probably going to get rid of my watch because my watch is telling me like too much now, like every five minutes, you're not sleeping enough, you're not sleeping enough, you know. As a matter of fact, this is no joke. But at some point, whether it be first, second, or third service, or fourth service, or all of them combined, my watch will warn me. You'll see me looking up my watch and hear a little beep thing that says the decibel level is too loud and sustained at this level, it will damage your ears, talking about my voice. So it is kind of interesting. There's no real advantage to my watch in that context. The point is there are so many really important things that we can learn from this passage. And by the way, if you are concerned about anti-semitism, if you're worried about the hatred of Jews becoming more and more of a problem, this is also another great passage that gives you insight as into why the Jews are not, who so many people say they are. And so there's a lot of this that we can get into. It's really, really important stuff. And I think it's a kind of stuff that sort of will help to open up our eyes. So this is the section now as we jump into chapter 11, we are talking about what they can eat and what they cannot eat. Now, just to give you a little bit of an idea here, in the first eight verses, we are going to deal with the, what we would call the land of mammals. Okay? And it's kind of an important thing. We'll read through these verses together. And then when we're done, we'll talk about some of the things that kind of jump out at us here. They are important rules and they mean something for a very specific reason and we'll dig into it. So let's jump into this here. We'll look in verse one of chapter 11 and it says this, it says, and the Lord, spake on tomozus and Aaron saying unto them, spake unto the children of Israel saying, these are the beasts which you shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth. Now, I just will say this right off the bat. We'll get into the reason why God created these rules and why he says what he says and why it's so consequential here in just a minute. But nonetheless, I think that it's important to recognize the fact that it met something to God for us to exercise discipline in the things that were chosen to be eaten. And by the way, the reasons for that I think on many levels were a whole lot more practical than they were maybe even ceremonial for lack of a better term. Okay? Now, we are going to see some ceremonial law issues come up within the context of many of these rules. But there's a very important reason why God says what he says and we'll dig into it, especially with the benefit of modern day science. You know what we've learned, which by the way is interesting. I have taught through this section. Well, I've taught through the book of Leviticus probably a total like from cover to cover. I've probably taught through Leviticus maybe 30 times, maybe. And what's interesting is every single time I go through it, when I chase the rabbit trail of trying to understand the significance of the animals that were given as correct or able to be eaten versus those that were prohibited, the science just is always changing or our access to the science changes. And it's really interesting sitting down and really researching why some of those animals are bad. And some of them will just like grow throughout like, here's the thing. If you want to go back and follow up on some of the things that I'm going to tell you today, whatever you do, don't go and research pork, okay? Don't go and learn about pigs because it will probably just absolutely gross you out completely. As a matter of fact, if you've eaten pork that's prepared in any restaurant for the most part, it's very likely that you've had some parasite entering to your body. In one way or another, like no joke, that's reality. By the way, chicken will do that too if it's also not prepared correctly. Chicken is probably one of the dirtiest animals out there. And so look, some of the seafood that's spoken about here, like I hate all seafood. So I just have a very spiritual moment when I see God prohibiting eaten lobster and shellfish and all that other stuff, you know what I mean? But just to see how dangerous some of that food is that is named and actually how gross. Like I could literally make you guys sick, make you never want to eat shrimp again. If I told you, like some of the stuff that shows up in just that alone or shellfish, it's nasty, okay? It's just nasty. So there's a reason. There's a rhyme to the reason. By what God says, you can eat and what you can't eat. It's why I good old hamburgers, I never mind. I just leave it alone. I just won't leave it be. Okay, so let's dig into this because it is important. So look what it says. It says, whatever, this is verse three. He says, whatsoever part of the hoof that is clove and footed and chew with the cut among the beasts, shall that shall you eat. In other words, it has to have both of those characteristics tied to it. Otherwise, you cannot eat it. It cannot be consumed and that's a very, very important characteristic here, okay? So let's go on. It says in verse four, nevertheless, these shall you not eat of them that chew the cut or of them that divide the hoof as the camel because he cheweth the cut but divide it's not the hoof. He is unclean unto you and the coney because he cheweth the cut but divided it not the hoof. He is unclean unto you. So some of these might have paws instead or some of them don't chew the cut but actually have that split hoof. Either one of them are disqualified because they don't have both of those characteristics there and you could spend a lot of time by the way going over examples of what these things look like and by the way, why God would say what He says. But you know, it's interesting. There's an interesting reason why cows are amongst one of the safest animals to eat. Thank you, Lord Jesus to God be the glory. I was thinking about that with Nicole and I were talking about what we were going to eat. Yesterday and she was talking about making a stake and I'm just thinking, Lord thank you. Thank you that we have that available and it's amongst the clean, you know, but I think the kids we got pizza dough and the kids made pizza. Well, it was a good dinner. But let's go on. It is an interesting one. So, uh, verse six and the hair because he cheweth the cut but divided it not the hoof. He is unclean unto you and the swine though he divided the hoof and be clove and footed yet he chewed, he cheweth not the cut. He is unclean to you of their flesh shall you not eat and of their and their carcass shall you not touch their unclean to you. Now, this is important because he does give some of these examples, right? There's those animals that have them both, right? Which are, uh, it's very, very easy to tell what's clean and what's unclean, what you're allowed to eat. So, for example, if they were to look at animals that were clean for them, it would be the cow, the sheep, the goat, you know, something like that. But then when you start talking about, um, those that were unclean, we heard that, right? The camel, for example, or the hair or swine. We were talking about all pigs, but it is interesting to say that and the command is don't eat their flesh and do not touch their carcasses. By the way, I should probably note this when it talks about not touching their carcasses, carcasses, the general assumption and it's probably a safe assumption to make as a matter of fact, it was understood by Jewish scholars even as early as, uh, 400 years prior to Christ's birth. Uh, the general assumption is we're talking about animals when they die naturally, okay? Kind of an important thing. Now, it is, it was generally practiced that Jews didn't even touch those animals just because they were not right, um, and they were not safe and that's kind of an interesting thing to point out. By the way, I should also point this out, which I think is kind of interesting and that is, that is, this is the reason why there were so many people amongst the Jews that were despised by the religious in some respects or another. I'll give you an example of this if you were of the tribe of Gad during the time of Christ. And you were, uh, in this area that was traditionally set aside for the Gatorians, you would not necessarily be respected by the average Jew because by trade, you were a pig farmer. That's pretty much what you did. You heard it pigs. And so we even see examples of this where, uh, Jesus is in a situation where he's in this land where the Gatorians are. You see a guy who is demon possessed. He's possessed with hundreds of thousands of demons, thousands at the bare minimum of demons. And then what does he do when the demons escape his body, uh, leave his body, Jesus sends him to the pigs. The pigs run over the cliff and end up dying. So kind of an interesting picture that's drawn there, they were not respected because of what they actually did. So when we get into verse nine and we go through verse 12, we're going to see a description of water creatures, which again, um, I just think this is my personal preference. I just think you should be safe and not eat anything that comes out of the water. It's just my recommendation. Just be safe. But the summary, look, it's really easy to summarize what you could eat and what you could not eat. When it came out of the water, the general rule was, and I'll read it right now, but the general rule is it had to have a fin and it had to have scales, okay? So if it has scales and it has a fin, then it's okay to eat anything outside of that. Don't touch it. As a matter of fact, that includes catfish because catfish might have a fin, but it doesn't have scales and catfish are nasty. Anyway, they're bottom feeders. You probably shouldn't eat bottom feeders, but you know, that's a whole other story. Uh, but you shouldn't eat fish, but you know, I don't know how many people, by the way, just hate seafood altogether. Anybody? Okay, so there's only a few of you. God bless you. Look at the hands that are up there. They're the anointed people in the fellow. No, I'm joking. I'm joking. I'm joking. It's that I've never liked seafood. You know, and it's funny because my sister shares that same feeling with me, but everybody else in my family always loved it. And I just, I don't understand. I always pray for them. You know, all right, let's jump into verse nine. It says this. It says, these shall you eat of all that are in the waters. Whatsoever have fins and scales in the waters in the seas and in the rivers, them shall you eat and all that have not fins and scales in the seas. And in the rivers of all that move in the waters and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you. And they shall be even abominations unto you. You shall not eat of their flesh, but you shall have their carcasses in abomination. Whatsoever have no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you. By the way, it's really interesting. You would think about this. What benefit would somebody have if they were taught that anything that didn't have a fin or scales would be an abomination to even touch? I mean, like what benefit would come from that? Well, there's a lot of benefit that comes from that because there's lots of people that have died from animals or from sea life that they've actually touched that didn't meet that description because there's lots of poisonous sea life. So there's a lot to be said about this. And if you ever sort of want to understand how dangerous sea life can actually be, just go to the aquarium. They'll give you a whole education on how that works. Any aquarium would work. But I'm telling you, it's so interesting to understand how this dynamic works. And then look at it in light of what God's word says. And it's going to make a lot of sense. Now when we get into verse 13, we'll get into the birds. We'll talk about that in just a second because the birds also are consequential. And we'll bring it all together. Right? I'm going to bring it all together to something that I hope will be very easy to understand. So let's take a look at this. And by the way, the birds, can I just tell you the birds don't give a, that we're not really given any easily identifiable characteristic amongst the birds in terms of if it has this, then eat it, if it doesn't, then don't. But I will tell you, which is kind of important. I will tell you that the predators and the scavengers, which are being described here, it would make total sense why they wouldn't be touched or why they wouldn't be eaten. And by the way, speaking of birds, I will just say this without running a tangent, which by the way, I should probably close my iPad because I haven't followed any of the rules, nor have I even switched pages because I'm just, I'm, whatever. So the point is birds are generally very dirty animals, okay? I'll give you an example of this when we, when we first bought a home together, Nicole and I, the very first home that we bought together, we had a problem with doves and pigeons that were hanging out on the roof of the house. And so for whatever reason, they like to perch on our roof. It was something that they did a lot. And so somebody comes to me, they say a neighbor, and they say, you know, James, you probably ought to deal with that. I said, why? Well, look, they're going to become a problem. More and more are going to show up. It's going to start looking ugly on your roof because all kinds of poops going to happen and all that. But here's the other thing you got to realize. When they, the more time they perch on your roof, the more disease your house is actually exposed to. What are you talking about? No way. That's not true. So I start researching it and I go to find out that when one of those little birds perch anywhere, the size of a quarter, if you just take the size of a quarter, there are thousands of little tiny bugs and disease little ridden things that actually are right in that space. It's super dangerous. It's like super dangerous. So not only did we have to put spikes all the way around our roof to keep them from coming and perching, but we also had to go so far as to actually spend several thousand dollars to have the roof cleaned because of how caustic it was and how dangerous it was. And then I even managed to find somebody who actually owned some hawks. And we have them fly around our neighborhood for a little while. They did it for free, by the way. They just did it as a favor. Flew hawks around the neighborhood. The pigeons were gone. They were like, no more. They were just gone. And that actually lasted for months and months and months. I don't know what's the status of it now because that's the old neighborhood, but it's just funny. These creatures can be very, very dirty. So the whole idea behind the prohibition that exists with respect to touching them or interacting with them, God had these amazing reasons for them. Okay, there are some bigger ones that we'll talk about in a minute, but it brings us back to a fact that oftentimes gets overlooked, but should not be overlooked. And we'll get into that in just a second. Look at verse 13. It says, and these are they which you shall have in abomination amongst the fals that they shall not be eaten. They are an abomination. The eagle and the and the osprey and the vulture and the kite after its kind, every raven after his kind and the owl and the knight hawk and the cook owl and the hawk after its kind and the little owl and the and the corboreant and the great owl and the swan and the pelican and the gear eagle and the stork and the heron after her kind and the lapwing and the bat, which we learned a lot about bats. I'll tell you that when a kid started on that, I won't even get into it. I'm just leaving the bad little bat thing alone, but these animals, these birds specifically, they can be pretty brutal. Okay? They are absolutely to be regarded in terms of the capability that they have, especially the scavengers. Even the predators as well. You know, I think for me as a kid, I always thought that that owls, for example, were just like these, you know, birds that were harmless. You know, Mr. Rogers, that's the only context I ever thought of an owl and, you know, little tiny glasses and whoo, you know, that kind of a thing. Well, we have owls in our neighborhood and they are, I'm telling you this right now, they are no joke. Those birds are wild. We have watched them pick up, like not cat-sized animals, but animals that are just big. Okay, we've watched it. Little baby possums and it's wild watching them fly with that in their mouth, especially near the night time. So they're definitely to be respected. I think that there's a reason for this, right? When you look at predators, when you look at scavengers, they are constantly in and around blood. Okay? They're in and around dead bodies. Okay? So by God saying they're unclean, don't touch them, don't eat them, it makes perfect sense for a lot of reasons. And we're going to get into the culmination of all of this. And then we get into insects, which by the way, this is an interesting one because from verse 20 to verse 23, what strikes me as astounding is the fact that there are people that try to conjure up how ignorant the Bible is over one technicality. Like for example, well, we'll get into it. I'll read it to you and I'll tell you why that's just such a foolish assertion to be making. But it is interesting getting into the prohibition of the insects, which by the way, they're all generally unclean with the exception of a few. And we'll talk about those. But it is interesting, which by the way, to this day, the ones that are capable of being eaten are eaten almost all all all around the world, but mostly in the Middle East, verse 20. It says this, it says, all fouls that creep going upon all four shall be an abomination unto you. Yet these may you eat of every flying creeping thing that go with upon all four, which have legs above their feet to leap with all upon the earth. So you can't be eaten flies, you can't be eaten spiders, you can't like all of those, which I think everybody's saying, okay, well, that makes sense. I don't really have a my mouth doesn't water. You know, when I see a spider climbing on the wall or anything like that, okay, kind of an interesting thing. But look what it goes on to say. It says, verse 22, even these of them, you may eat the locust after his kind and the bald locust after his kind and the beetle after his kind and the grasshopper after his kind, but all other flying creepy things, which have four feet shall be an abomination unto you. Which by the way, this is the part where it says which have four feet, okay. When you read this in the original language, it's not implying that every single one of these insects that's being spoken about all have four feet. What it's talking about is it's identifying the crawler, okay. So the person that would read this in the original language would understand it to mean anything that crawls, okay. So we're not just talking about insects that have four feet, which there are some, but we're talking about the ones that have six feet and eight feet, meaning any of them that crawl basically. And so that's virtually all of the insects that we know about. So that's what it's talking about here. You can't eat a tranchilla, although there's lots of people around the world that eat those things. It's nasty. You know, that kind of thing, you could eat a cricket if you wanted to. You could eat most different types of locusts if you wanted to. So if you ever have that lollipop that had the cricket in it, you weren't breaking the law. Or if you had a chocolate covered cricket, you weren't breaking the law. I had a chocolate bar once it had crickets in it. And they told me after the fact that it had crickets in it. And I still didn't regret eating it. It was pretty good. Actually, you know, it had a nice like a like a crunch like it was like I was eating a crunch bar. Then it wasn't all that bad. I mean, I'm just saying it. I just it was kosher. So I mean, what what what what are we doing here? Okay. Oh, man. So let's go on verse 24. It says this, it says, and for these, you shall be unclean, whosoever touches the carcass of them that shall be unclean until the evening, and whosoever beareth ought of the carcass of them shall watch his clothes and be unclean until the even the carcass of every beast which divided the hoof and is not cloven-footed, nor chewed the cudd or unclean unto you. Everyone that touches them shall be unclean. And whatsoever, or whosoever, sorry whatsoever, goes upon his paws among all manner of beasts that go on all four. Those are unclean unto you whoso touched their carcass shall be unclean until the even verse 28. And he that beareth the carcass of them shall watch his clothes and be unclean until the even. And they are unclean unto you. So it's kind of an interesting picture here that's being drawn. By the way, this is where I'll get into one of the reasons why God set up these rules. Okay. And I know that this might not be received well by some people, but that's okay. Doesn't have to be received well by them. Okay. You can take your anti-Semitic Jew hating view and you can literally send it back to hell where it came from. And this is where I would probably offer up a warning where I would just simply explain this. Don't believe people just because they have large audiences. Okay. Just because they have large audiences doesn't mean they are intelligent. Just because they have large audiences doesn't mean that they have real, serious or impressive intellect. As a matter of fact, some of the people that are online right now that are praised as being smart, praised as having intellect. I'm telling you right now they're idiots. And I'm not trying to say that to be funny. I'm not trying to say that to be harsh, but it's it's remarkable to me how sin makes you incredibly stupid. It's to me, it's incredible how demonic inspiration can completely change the message that somebody brings. And yet it's they will they will do it at the expense of completely selling their souls to the very devil that they worship, the very devil that they continue to praise. And it's just evil. It's super evil. It's wrong, especially the ones who continue on with the anti-Semitic tropes who continue to blame Israel for everything who continue to lie cheap and steal because that's what they do. You know, I think it's really funny about some of these. I think it's really funny because if they didn't have their online presence, not only would they not have anything to their names, okay? But they wouldn't survive for five minutes in the real world because they cannot complete simple concepts. One of the ones that I just heard and I'm telling you I cannot stand it. And the only reason why I will not mention her name from the pulpit is because it would be like cursing from the pulpit. I don't want to make this pulpit unholy by mentioning some of these names. But I just recently heard one say something to the effect of don't you think that it's a coincidence, the fact that when the whole world was dying of different plagues throughout the tenure of history, the Jews were all healthy and none of them died. Don't you think that's a more than a coincidence? It would seem to me as though they were the ones responsible for the plague that the rest of the world died from. It's satanic. It's a baloney lie. If you had half a brain, if you could think any more brilliantly than about that of a rock, you would understand by reading Leviticus chapter 11 why the Jews were not susceptible to that type of death. If they touched a carcass, they were considered to be unclean for a day. Not ceremonially, plain and simple, they had to go wash themselves. And after they washed themselves, they could not hang around people for a day. If they found a rat in their house, they had to pick up the rat, take the rat where they needed to, they were required to burn it to get rid of it. And then once they got rid of it, they had to be separated from their family, their community for their jobs for literally a whole day. They became very innovative, very innovative on how not to contact these animals. They became very innovative in making sure they didn't come into their houses. They became very serious about what they touched and what they didn't touch. And you know what it did? It saved their lives. When everybody was getting sick because they did not know how to stay clean in a way that kept their immune systems protected, the Jews knew it. They knew it because they had the word of God, which by the way was available to everybody else if they wanted to listen to it. If they all wanted to follow the same rules, they themselves would have remained intact. I think there's something to be said here and I think there's an old destructive satanic mindset that exists. Where people who find themselves in successful positions because of the God-fearing rules that they applied are oftentimes condemned as though they did something to lie, steal and cheat. I said lie, steal and cheat. You got to teach me to catch that? That's what sleep deprivation will do to you. To lie, cheat and steal. It's amazing to me. It's amazing. Biblical principles oftentimes bring out ragiously wonderful results. You put Biblical principles in the way that you work. It will bring great results. You put Biblical principles in how you manage your finances. It will bring amazing results. You put Biblical principles in the things that you do every single day and it will change things for you in ways you never thought possible. Because God rewards those who keep His word. And by the way, one of the most powerful places to learn how to experience oftentimes with the world refers to as success is looking at the Old Testament law. Because the Old Testament law is filled, filled with insights on business. Filled with insights on money and all the other things that were told, oh, don't do any of that. You should stay away from all that. That's all evil. I just got rebuked by somebody the other day. James, you know, money is evil. Okay, go back and read your Bible. It's the love of money that is the root of all kinds of evil. Big difference. My point behind it is the Bible gives us lots of powerful insight. teaches us what to touch, what not to touch, what to do, what not to do. We follow those rules. And I think things end up allowing us to become the beneficiaries when we walk in obedience. So now we're going to get into the reptiles. This is interesting, by the way. The reptile section and the creeping things section, it's a longer section. Okay, there's a reason for that. We'll get into that in just a second. And he gives us all kinds of good ideas too. The geckos, the chameleons, and we'll see all that. So let's jump in. And it says this. It says starting in verse 29, it says, these also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon that creep upon the earth, the weasel and the mouse and the turdice, the turdice. I always, I never say that right. Sorry. After his kind and the ferret and the chameleon and the lizard and the snail and the mole, these are unclean to you among all that creep, whosoever does touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the evening. Okay, again, these are health and safety rules. Okay, very, very important to be able to see this. Super important. Look what it goes on to say. It says an upon whatsoever any of them, and sorry, an upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, the fall, it shall be unclean, whether it be any vessel of wood or rain or rainment or skin or skin of any sack whatsoever vessel. It be wherein any work is done. It must be put into water and it shall be unclean until the evening, so it shall be cleansed. In every earth and vessel, where into any of them, falleth whatsoever is in it shall be unclean and you shall break it of all meat which may be eaten on that which such water comeeth shall be unclean and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean and everything where upon any part of the carcass falleth shall be unclean, whether it be of or whether it be oven or ranges for posts or for pots and they shall be broken down for they are unclean and shall be unclean unto you. Nevertheless, a fountain or pit wherein there is plenty of water shall be unclean, but that which touches their carcass shall be unclean and if any part of their carcass fall upon any sewing seed which is to be sewn, it shall be clean. But if any water be put upon the seed and any part of their carcass fall therein, it shall be unclean unto you. There is a reason for this. Like I chase this down and that is also an interesting thing. If water is involved, it becomes unclean. If there is no water when it touches, then it is still clean and there is a massive reason for that because it deals with the idea that water can help spread the transmission as it is being allowed to soak into the soil, believe it or not. So lots of different types of food poisoning by eating vegetables happen as a result of this type of thing. As a matter of fact, when people were getting really sick of salmonella and some of these other diseases, it was happening because of this dynamic. You know you'd have some creature that would walk through an infestation of creatures that would walk through a certain farm, they would defecate or spend some time chomping away some of the food or whatever or go into the barn house and get a hold of the seed or whatever it creates this kind of illness, but only within the context of how water interacts with it and how it actually goes into the soil. So these rules that are being created here, they're pretty remarkable. I think it's amazing how brilliance of the God who created these things, you know, surprise, surprise. Okay, it's pretty remarkable. Look what it goes on to say, we'll just go back for context and we'll read verse 37. And if any part of their carcass fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it shall be clean, but if any water be put upon the seed and any part of their carcass fall there on it shall be unclean unto you. And if any beast of which you may eat die, he touches the carcass thereof shall be unclean until the evening. So even if it's an animal that you're allowed to eat, even if it's not an animal that's unclean, if you find that animal dead, the general assumption is natural causes. If you find the animal dead, you're not to touch it. If you are, if you do touch it, you've got to go wash up. You can't interact with anybody for a whole day. Pretty important. In some cases, it would only be a few hours. It just dependent on the distance between the time that you had touched it and what was generally considered sundown. Okay, but for the most part, you were you were done for the day if you touched any of those animals. And he that eateth of the carcass of it shall watch his clothes and be unclean until the even. And he also that beareth the carcass of it shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the even. So again, you still had the wash up and then you were unclean, meaning you could not be near anybody any of the general population. And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an abomination. It shall not be eaten for obvious reasons, right? So whatsoever goes upon the belly and whatsoever goes upon all four and whatsoever half more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them you shall not eat for they are an abomination. You shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth neither shall you make yourselves unclean with them that you should be defiled thereby. For notice this, for I am the Lord your God, you shall therefore sanctify yourselves and you shall be holy for I am holy neither shall you defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. Notice what he says, for I am the Lord that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt to be your God, you shall therefore be holy for I am holy, okay? We gotta stop here because this is such an important lesson to be taught and that is this. If God hath redeemed us, that's what he's saying here. He says, I redeemed you. I gave myself for you, okay? Your responsibility is to be as I am. I am holy. He's not asking that you walk in perfection. He's not saying that you be flawless. He's saying that you walk in obedience to him. This is something that's very, very misunderstood. He's basically saying, I have modeled for you the way that you should live and it is my expectation that you carry that function. He says, don't defile yourselves. I saved you out of Egypt. Remember the redemption. I think the application applies here. He says to us, I gave my son for you. My expectation is that you walk in obedience to me, that you serve me, that you love me, that you show that love, you demonstrate that love, that you demonstrated through the life of obedience that you choose to live. That's a powerful lesson by the way. Guys, look, the foundational principle that should be carried here is God as Redeemer has the right to command obedience. Okay? Let me say that one more time. God as our Redeemer, not only has the right, he has the obligation to command obedience. We're called by him to obey. He saved us. And one of my children the other day come up to me and they ask me this very, very smart question. I had to pause for a second because I wanted to react harshly, you know, I wouldn't identify which one. You'd be surprised if you knew who. Baba, why do I have to obey you? No joke. Why do I have to obey you? Boy, I had a whole lot of answers to give that young person, almost gave it away, to give that person a whole lot of things I was ready, locked them low, just ready to go. Sometimes you just want to say, because I said, you know, that's that's what you that's what you want to say. Right? I found myself having to ask one of the scariest and most riskiest questions that any father could ever ask a child. And that's this. Honey, have I ever lied to you? No, Baba. When I tell you that I'm going to do something, do I do it? Yeah, Baba. Okay. God gave his son for me and you, that we wouldn't go to hell. Don't you think it's the wise thing to do, the right thing to do, the correct thing to do to obey God because God did that for us? Ready for this? Yeah, Baba, but that's not my question. No joke. I'm talking to you. God said, that's why. God said, he put me in your life to be your father. Then he told you, obey your mother and your father because it's right. Okay, Baba, go on to the next thing. Really simple. The authority of the word of God is critical. God said, I, I did so much for you. So my expectation is that you respond to me reasonably. My expectation is that you, you would become a person who would understand the fact that my commands to you are set aside for the purpose of you benefiting even when you don't understand it. That's what it's about. I think we have to understand the fact that God gave himself for us, to us, helped us. And in that redemption, the right service, the reasonable service is to walk in obedience to him. By the way, this conversation I was telling about was in a much larger context and the bigger context was just understanding some of the things that they don't, they don't realize because they don't live a life like what they've seen. They don't know what it's like to be without. They don't know what it's like to not have the things that they want. They don't know what it's like to be hungry on a regular basis. They don't know what it's like to not live in a beautiful home. They don't know what it's like to not have a safe neighborhood. They don't know any of that stuff. They're never going to know any of that stuff. Nor were there children or no were there children's children being that in that place. But all of it goes back to the fact that when these things have been given to you, when God has blessed you with these things, how much more should we be seeking to bless him? Such an interesting aspect of all of this. Let me read the rest of these verses and then we're going to get into one simple discourse here that I think is really important. He says verse 46, this is the law of the beasts and of the foul and of every living creature that move within the waters and every creature that creeps upon the earth to make a difference between the unclean and the clean between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten. Look, it's really simple. There were three purposes that I believe God did this. Three main purposes. First, the obvious, the protection of health. Right? He did it so that their health would be the greatest, would be one of the great beneficiaries of these rules. We talked about the scavengers and the predators and the bloodborne pathogens and all the other things that doing all of these things would save you from. You would not be subject to the plagues that the world has died over all of this stuff. It would just all be God. It wouldn't even be an issue because you were obeying certain rules. That's the first reason. The second reason, God needed to create distinctions. That's a word. I want you to remember that word. It's an important word. We're going to be carrying that word all throughout the Old Testament. God created distinctions that separated them from the rest of the world. Those distinctions are really, really important. Today, I released a video where I provided input into a conversation that you've all know a Harari had with somebody at the World Economic Forum regarding AI and how, in essence, AI in his mind is going to basically take over the position of God and of all humanity. It's a recent conversation. He's had, he's been talking about this empty rhetoric for a long time. But in that video, I was able to aptly demonstrate how the spirit of Antichrist works, how easy it is to come to these conclusions based on the perception of matters that are false and how dark things can become when God has taken out of the equation. Completely, take it out of the equation. God makes it clear. He says it. I want you to be separated from the pagan nations. He set the Jews up to be distinct from the rest of the world. Some people might argue, they're not fulfilling that now, baloney. The most unique nation of the country, I mean, in the world. Whether or not anybody wants to admit it, the third reason and the one that I think is perhaps one of the most important reasons, the one that I think lots of critical issues rest upon is the demonstration of obedience to God. The God sets up distinguishing rules and he wants us to walk in obedience knowing full well that we become the greatest beneficiaries of that obedience. I think that's a hard concept for people to understand because in many cases, we choose not to trust God. We don't trust him. We choose not to trust him in a lot of areas, but if we knew, if we knew to put our faith in trust in him, it would change so many rules. By the way, let me just clarify this, because I think this is also an important distinction to make. This is not telling you that as a New Testament believer, as we would say, as a non-Jew, as a Gentile, you're required to follow all these dietary laws. Because the Bible makes it very, very clear. Acts 15 is probably the most powerful passage to go through that talks about that when we look at the Jerusalem Council that determined that the only thing that they were not to do is they weren't to eat meat, strangle meat, basically sacrifice to idols and to stay away from fornication. In other words, the Levitical Law was no longer binding to them. Although it's interesting because the law of God, as we see, expressed in the revealing of the Old Testament through the functional advertisement of the New, is actually far more strict than that of the Old Testament, quite frankly. If you want to ask me, there's lots of other passages to talk about this collotions and Timothy and Romans and lots of other things. We have the ability to say, what we're going to eat this. So for those of you that love shellfish, you can go ahead and eat that for those, whatever, you can have all that. Okay. The point behind what I'm sharing with you today and the reason why I say it's extremely valid in the moment in which we live is God set these things up for our maximum benefit. Now, yes, we're these two the Jews absolutely, but it was two the Jews because they were to be an example to the rest of the world. So if there to be an example to the rest of the world, you would think that the expectation of God would be to do the same thing. Does God want people to be healthy? Yes. Does God want people to succeed and experience abundance? Absolutely. Absolutely. But we're the ones that choose to make the decision not to obey God. We ignore the things that God has put in front of us and we oftentimes become the ones who experience the detriment as a result. And then we go around and we blame God for something that God never did. Right? Look, passages like this should be a reminder to us that God's word is to be highly regarded and that God's word is important and that God's word is valuable. And every single person who understands modern science today knows understands the wisdom in these commands that were issued. Very, very, very important. And guys, the one thing that I would say is I would also point out the fact that Christ lived the law of God perfectly, meaning he kept to these dietary rules. Okay? He lived these things out perfectly so that we wouldn't. We wouldn't have to. He bore our uncleanliness. He took the penalty without being polluted himself. If you understand what I mean, in other words, he lived a perfect life, then he was judged for us. Guys, what Christ has done for us is remarkable. And then on top of that, which is perhaps the most consequential and significant aspect of all of this, he triumphed literally triumph in the resurrection. Didn't he? He beat death. And now we have the freedom to experience all of that and we become the direct beneficiaries of everything that God has made available to us in his word. We have to take it seriously. We have to recognize it for what it is and say, Lord, thank you for what you've done and what we have because you're faithful and you're good. Amen? Father, we thank you, Lord, for your word and we thank you for the opportunity that we continue to have to dig deeply into your word to understand what your word has to say. And, Lord, I just pray that we would be inspired to walk obediently to you, Lord. Lord, that we would listen, not only listen to your word, that we would obey your word because, Lord, you're faithful and you're good. So go before us, Lord, fill us with your spirit. Keep us close to you, seeking you, looking to you. We love you, Father. And we ask these things in Jesus' name, we pray. Amen. All right, listen, the brothers are coming up. They're going to be available to pray for you. If you have any prayer requests, we are here. We'd love to encourage you guys. Tonight, we jump into Isaiah. We go to 21. It's going to be a good one. You guys don't want to miss out on that. Also continue to pray for us regarding the church building. We should start seeing some major developments this week is that's what we're praying for. So we're praying that the Lord open up that door. Okay? Love you guys. God bless you. Keep fighting. The good fight. We'll see you tonight."
16,b33f91e7be7d7e59,9767,49531,en,whisper_local,base,v1.0,"2026-02-18 03:17:33","Welcome to E-Media, a manual's very own collection of podcasts. We are so excited to bring you a variety of topics from the fun and lighthearted stuff to even the more serious stuff that will impact together. Our podcasts will be available through video and audio so you can watch us or listen to us anywhere that you are. Now, here's the latest episode from the E-Media podcast. Come on, if you're glad to be in God's house today, find three people around you, give them a high five and tell them God is here, God is here, God is here, come on, tell them God is here, God is here, God is here. And he is, he is, he is where two or three are gathered together in the presence of God. There he is in the midst also. Come on, let's remain standing for the reading of God's Word. Come on, turn with me to Matthew, chapter five. Matthew, sorry, Matthew, chapter six today, starting at verse 19. Let's turn there. Matthew, chapter six, starting at verse 19 and those. Welcome to church today as we have been in a sermon series called The Red Letterway. Have you enjoyed this series so far? As we, okay, four people, let me ask again. Have you enjoyed this series so far? Okay, there we go. There we go. All right, all right, here we go. You almost had a late night last night, right? It's Valentine's weekend. Let's wake up, amen? Too much chocolate last night, right? So we've been focusing in, really in January on a journey with what Jesus said, you know, many times in the scripture where you see the red letter, it's what Jesus said himself. And so we've been on a journey as a church starting in January that's running us really through May, focusing on the five things that Jesus spoke on the most and really diving into the words and letting them transform us and then sending us out to be the church. And so we are on really the third saying we started with what? Being? How to be with God? We just finished up last week. Didn't Pastor Jake do an amazing job last week on forgiveness? Awesome job, Pastor Jake. We talked about forgiving, yes? And then today we dive into the third word that Jesus spoke on really more than anything we're going to talk on. He talked about money and possessions and giving really more than anything in the New Testament. So today we're starting that third word on giving. Somebody say giving. So today we begin a mature adult conversations about money. Can we do that today? A lot of times when we hear that word money or giving or possessions, a lot of times there are preconceived notions that come into our mind of what has been portrayed to us. And I understand when you see the crazy TV preacher at 3 a.m. talking about send me money and I'll send you the miracle spring water. Come on how many have seen that before? Or you send me money and I'll send you to prayer handkerchief and that I've prayed over and you're going to receive healing. No wonder we have this thought or this notion of what we think it is. And so my job the next three weeks or so is to really give us a theological framework on what finances mean. A biblical example of what Jesus said of what finances are to really help us gain an understanding. Because until we gain understanding until we really don't know what it says biblically we will remain in ignorance. Hello somebody. And what we are not informed on we will remain ignorant in. And so what we've got to do is begin to reframe what we think and put it back on what the word says. And hopefully that's why you came today. Is that why you came today? You came because you want the truth of God's word. You did not come for a patty cake, patty cake, baker's man. Treat me as sermon as quick as you can. Roll it and pat it and mark it with an S for a sermon for me. No that's not why you came. You didn't come for three points and a poem did you? How many came for the truth of God's word today? And that is why we are here. And so we're going to look in scripture. So today our journey starts us in Matthew chapter 6 starting at verse 19. I'm going to read this whole section through verse 33 of what Jesus said and let the truth of God's word settle on our hearts today. Are you ready for a journey today? So if you are a guest welcome to your first Sunday at Emmanuel starting at verse 19 it says this. Do not stir up for yourselves treasures on earth where moths and vermin some translations say or rust destroy where thieves break in and steal but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where moths and vermin do not destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal for where your treasure is there your heart will be also the eye of the lamp of the body the eye is the lamp of your body if your eyes are healthy your whole body will be full of light but if your eyes are unhealthy your whole body will be full of darkness if then the light is within your darkness how great is that darkness? Yes? Verse 24 no one serves two masters either you will hate the one and love the other or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other you cannot serve both God and money. Therefore I tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or drink or about your body what you will wear is not life more than food and the body more than clothes look at the birds of the air they do not sorrow or reap or store away in barns yet your heavenly father feeds them are you not more to more valuable than they can any one of you be by worrying at a single hour to your life and why do you worry about clothes see the flowers of the field grow they do not labor or spin yet I can tell you this that none not even Solomon and all of his splendor was dressed like one of these if that is how God closed the grass of the field which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire will he not much more clothe you you of little faith so do not worry saying what shall we eat what shall we drink or what shall we wear for the pagans run around after these things and your heavenly father watch this knows that you need them here's the premise of the whole passage verse 33 but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well bless the reading of God's word today amen today I want to speak to a message entitled matters of the heart matters of the heart holy spirit speak to us now we need you to hear what you say not what we think but what you say speak to us in a powerful way give me the words in Jesus name and the people of God said and the people of God said fist bump your neighbor on your way to your seat and tell them your heart matters and then you may be seated today this Christmas was a special Christmas we kind of have the same routine and tradition we have pretty much every year we finish up our Christmas Eve services here somewhere around four or five o'clock and my favorite part of the holidays is when the last service is over I get loaded up in my car and we head on over to my parents house and we have a party y'all we have a great time at Christmas with my relatives I am one of four I'm the baby of of of four so I have two older brothers and older sister and some of the most special times are on Christmas Eve when we gather around the the table we eat and we hang out with my family and then we kind of distribute gifts from there and so this year was special more than any other year because my mom who is very sentimental at times where all my mom's at come on somebody sentimental at times you know so she she had all the all the siblings break up into different sections of the of the room and and so of course you know my corner I got five kids so I take up the largest corner y'all so so our corner with five kids and my wife and I my brothers my sisters and all the all the cousins there's a lot of roomful there and then she distributes everybody a gift and we open this gift me and my siblings and it was this box right here and so we open it up inside and she got us this special gift y'all want to see it today y'all want to see it okay that's why I brought I was hoping you'd say yes okay and so she got us one of uh oh I don't know I want to make sure I don't break this thing she got us one of these things y'all ever seen these ceramic Christmas trees before and so I took it out of the box and when I first looked at it and I'm like okay Mary Christmas mom thank you for the ceramic Christmas tree that's cool I mean we kids will love it as you plug you can plug it in and it lights up and it glows that's cool and not only did I get one but all my siblings uh got one so I mean it's cool it looks like something you could probably get at home depot right hello somebody no not a home depot can they are expensive okay Walmart somebody said Walmart we are talking expensive now right how about tarjet can we find them at tarjet how many like that fine French spending at tarjet right so I don't know where you can buy them but you know I mean it's it's pretty cool it's a nice Christmas gift I thank you mom and so for you when you look at it just like I look at it I mean done a little like a whole lot but it's cool it's a cool Christmas repair but then my mom got to talking y'all and it took on a whole new level y'all I mean it did so the first she started first with my oldest brother and he got the same kind of one that looked a little bit different and uh and my other brother uh as well joined in on a conversation and and she told them the one I'm giving to you that ceramic Christmas tree that I'm I'm giving to you I don't know if you remember or not but that's the same tree that was at your grandmother's house and when you were boys were young uh they're in their 50s now my older brothers are in the 50s you guys were running around the house and when you were about five or six years old do you remember that you ran past that ceramic tree and you knocked it off the counter and it shattered you remember that and my brother started crying I'm like oh snap this got deep real quick because he's named his middle name was after my grandparents and my grandmother mother came over to him and said don't worry about it she took the pieces together and she glued it back together that was the same tree that my brother got then she looked at me and said mark this that I'm giving you and your family uh this is a special tree because uh your aunt say I'm named after my grandfather and so his sister brought this bought it and brought it to my parents because my parents some of you know my dad served here uh since 1986 he was the lead pastor and retired back in 2020 so numerous years over 30 years he was the pastor here but some of you probably don't know his previous story before he arrived he was actually a farmer in Sussex County who was dramatically changed by the gospel him and my mom and so they literally sold everything to go into ministry and they moved to South Carolina from my dad to go to Bible college so he was going so he had four kids he was in Bible college and he was bagging groceries on the side just to support his family and my mom told me that when we went to South Carolina a bustling metropolis called Monks Corner South Carolina you probably never heard of it but it's a small little tiny town in South Carolina out in bum nowhere I mean in the middle of nowhere and my mom said that literally what kept me sane during that time was you because you were so small you're only about a year old so all the kids went to school and your dad went to Bible college and then he was bagging groceries and so you were the only one that kind of kept you were around you were small you're about a year old so I took care of you gave me joy in a difficult time and so this tree is the representation of your grandparents who your great aunt came down to South Carolina with this tree and gave that to us as just a momentum to just cheer us up to just say that people are thinking about you so when she's telling me to store you all I'm like man my allergies are bad y'all this I'm not crying you're crying I'm just my allergy I mean it hit me hard so all of a sudden all of a sudden from the moment I see it it didn't mean much to me at first on the surface level I didn't really understand it but when I got the backstory of it y'all this thing means something to me this thing matters to me this thing has deeply affected me because because can you even put a price tag on a backstory I mean you couldn't write me a check large enough to pay for this thing because of the sentimental mat value it has to me because it deals with the matters of my heart have you ever heard of that terminology before the matters of the heart I'm sure you have it talks about when something touches you when it has deep impact inside of your life that it touches your soul it transforms your soul it really means something to you it matters to you that is what the matters of the heart is so this thing is is extremely valuable to me it is affected me deep in the matters of my heart now the reason why I tell all of you that today is because not only I but many inside of this room have been deeply impacted by the presence of God in our lives if that's you raise your hand and say yes today I mean let's take a journey back let's let's talk about the backstory of your life God saved you God set you free God delivered you God changed your life God transformed you matter of fact it's a miracle that some of us are even sitting inside of this room today because you were bound by addiction the divorce had you down you thought your life was over you thought you were dead but God stepped in at your lowest moment and he changed you so on the surface level when you see my life when you see the life of those sitting around you it might not look like much on the surface but if you could get the backstory you would see that it means something to me all it matters to me because of how deeply affected I have been by the presence of God that's the time to pause to say is anybody grateful for your backstory is anybody grateful today what God has done has anybody been changed it transformed by the presence of God that has made such a deep impact on you I better slow down a little bit I've gone preaching already this thing matters to me and I know it matters to many inside of this room so it might not look like much on the surface but if you can get back to the surface and get down below the surface level you will see that it is affecting me the presence of God and the love of God and the grace of God and the mercy of God has so deeply affected my life that you can't even put a price tag on that y'all it is priceless the way the Holy Spirit now resides within us and has caused and affected so much change it is the most instrumental force we have experienced inside of our life and I'm praying for you that if you have never experienced a transforming power of God today would be your day because it is so deeply affected many of us y'all that and it is so instrumental we have been changed in the matters of our heart our heart has been changed by him therefore therefore the way I live matters the way I treat people matters it didn't matter before but now the matters of my heart have changed I see how God dealt with me and because of the way God dealt with me I deal with others differently now how I treat people is different it matters to me forgiveness matters to me and also my giving matters notice I how I said how my giving matters the reason why I mention that today is because generosity is the indication and the byproduct of a people who have been deeply impacted by the presence of God and when you've been impacted by it you want to participate in it because it's changed the matter of my heart now when we talk about this listen I want you to I want you to hear everybody good today is everybody with me today everybody listen listen this is what I want to tell you today contrary to popular belief money mattered to Jesus now it's different than what you think it matters to Jesus but money mattered to Jesus matter of fact Jesus talked did you know this Jesus talked more about money possessions and generosity and giving more than any other topic in the gospel why would Jesus talk about it so much the reason why Jesus talked about it so much is because he knew that what we do with money is the indication of what matters most to us inside of a heart when Jesus talks about money he is not trying to get something from you he is trying to get something for you a heart that is lived and set free and lives in freedom a faith that is fearless a life that is lived open handed and so when we talk about generosity when we talk about money when we talk about giving the best starting place that we have to start y'all is is one of the most profound and impactful statements Jesus talks about it over in the sermon on the mount in Matthew chapter 5 6 and 7 settled right in the heart of it right in the meat of it what matters the most Jesus talks about in the heart of it he talks about money and possessions and this is what he says in verse 19 y'all with me today say yes it says this do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moths and vermin or some translations say rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven somebody say heaven where moths and vermin do not destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal watch this verse 21 for where your treasure is there your heart will be also i want you to notice what Jesus is doing here Jesus is beginning to contrast to completely opposing opposite places where we can store up our treasure he first starts talking about storing up treasures in this earth where he says that moth and vermin or rust can destroy where thieves break in and steal but then simultaneously he follows it with saying that we should store up treasures in heaven and he gives the complete opposite of what he's just said where he says in heaven where moths and and and vermin and rust do not destroy because when you store up things in this earth here is the result the result is that nothing in this world ever last and it never will but kingdom investment in treasures in heaven is something that is lasting and something that is permanent now this is what i want you to notice about it what i want you to notice is Jesus did not say to have no treasure Jesus said just be careful where you store it he is not condemning owning possessions he is warning against possessions owning you so the real heart of the issue of the matter is this it is not that you have it's a matter of what has you inside of your heart it gets quiet when you talk about this subject doesn't it and so what Jesus is inviting us in on is something amazing here for us to get to a point in place in our lives where the way we handle our treasure would really show here's the point our loyalty our legions and where our heart really lies that's the first thing i want to talk to you about today i want to talk to you about treasure somebody say treasure now what i want to do for you today is i want to draw your attention just like Jesus did to the place at which you store your treasure because where you store you need to see it for what it is see it for the way Jesus speaks you see where you store is significant because it really shows you where your heart is settled to completely opposing opposite places to store your treasure is important for us to look at because it what it really does it reveals where your heart really resides you see we can store our treasure in things of the earth matter of fact let me say it this way that when we only settle ourselves to see investment or to give to things of the earth Jesus says himself that it is temporary it is temporal the things that are tangible don't even last very long it is fragile it is futile it is subject to decay it is it is it is it is decelerating on its on its value it is it is decreasing or depreciating on its value and it opens itself up to be lost or stolen but contrary to that Jesus has says that when we invest in the kingdom when we store up treasures in heaven it is not something temporary or temporal but it is eternal lasting longer than we even know so when he begins to talk about the kingdom of heaven to store up treasures in heaven Jesus is not talking for about us to store up something so we escape the world later somehow it is waiting on us when Jesus begins to talk about the kingdom of heaven he is talking about God's dominion lived in reality now Jesus let me remind you of Jesus prayer your kingdom come your will be done on earth as it is in heaven he is talking about his kingdom being brought down in the earth he is talking he is talking about his purposes his plan being produced in the earth now he is talking about him ruling and raining over high and redeeming men back to himself and we everybody say we we as the people of God get to participate in this kind of thing when we invest can I get to the heart of what I am trying to say today here is what I am trying to get at this morning what I am trying to get is what you do with money is the indication of what really matters most inside of your heart what you do with money what you do with your treasure let me say it this way what you do with your treasure is the indication of what you truly treasure and by truly treasure I mean this what matters most to you what you do with money is the indication of what matter most to you what you do with money is the indication of what you truly value and the truth is when you truly value something you want to invest in it it's the investment and what amazes me about most people you see how quiet it is when you start talking about money what amazes me about so many people is our willingness to invest in earthly things that are depreciating and then to last but completely ignore investing in the purposes in the kingdom of God which last forever why would we do that why why would we do that I'm going to tell you why we do it because what we do with money is the indication of what matters most to us in our heart here it comes and what matters most to you in your heart becomes your master don't get mad at me don't get mad at me take it up with Jesus Jesus said it like this in verse 24 no one can serve to masters either you will hate one and love the other or you will be devoted to the one and despise or other here it comes you cannot serve both God and money please hear me today please hear me hear my heart today Jesus is not anti money he's anti money mastering you hello somebody and then he gets through the heart of the matter in verse 21 verse 21 look at verse 21 literally says for where your treasure is there your heart will be also the heart goes where the treasure goes show me your treasure and I'll show you your heart that's why generosity that's why giving has been and will always be a heart issue always has been a heart issue listen where your treasure is going your heart has already been living because where your treasure is your heart naturally flows and where your heart is your treasure naturally flows that means if money matters most to me it'll show me what I truly value watch this watch this that means you're spending you're spending shows you what matters most to you you're sacrificing shows you what matters most to you you're longing your desires shows you what is mattering more to you listen listen listen listen it is the indication you see it for what it is okay so so so you can see you've got to be able to see what matters most to you not what your lips proclaim matter most to you because it's not a matter of what your lips proclaim it's a matter what your ledger records it's not a matter of what you vocalize it's a matter of what you invest in it's not a matter of what you gab about it's a matter of what you actually give to well yeah I guys should have never came to church today I knew it honey it's only a matter of time for they started talking about money but there comes a point listen I'm not saying you spend it all and you be stupid with it and you just give it all away that's not what I'm talking about here today I'm not talking you got to be responsible you got to be a steward with the blessing that God has given you but here is what I'm trying to tell some of us today who don't who talk about it but you ain't about it sometimes you got to put your money where your mouth is here's what I mean by that there has to be evidence not what you say but evidence you got to have some receipts as the young people say I got receipts I there's got to be evidence in your life that you actually value you now what you vocalize show me what is recorded because if you can't find evidence of it in your life that tells me that there is a hard issue that you have to deal with you've got to look as Jesus says where is your loyalty where is your allegiance where is your treasure and what we have y'all is more than a giving issue it is a lordship issue of who is lord in our life are y'all okay with me today and Jesus goes from treasury and then he starts talking about worry did you notice that he starts talking about words birds and he talks about lilies as a living sermon as if to say they don't strive to get yet they are adorned and sustained and if God cares for his creation how much more his children if he values watch this feeding creation and clothing flowers how much more the people of God that are made in his own image and so Jesus is trying to get you to see today you matter to him you mean something to not I know it doesn't look like much on the surface level I know it might not matter to you sometimes of how you see you but when he sees you he knows your backstory he knows your purpose and what he called you to you matter to him so then Jesus goes in to say hey listen don't worry about what you're going to eat or drink don't worry about what you're going to wear don't worry about tomorrow don't worry about any of those things why not worry why not anxiety because worry and anxiety over money is the indication also that you are the source of your own supply that you provide for yourself that I've got a whole tight to it because I don't know when it's coming back my way again and that's a lot of pressure and anxiety to deal with inside of your own life so Jesus is inviting us in on a trusting relationship that our God will provide you can trust God that he will come through that's the second thing I'm going to give you today I want to talk to you about trust everybody say trust now when we talk about worry when Jesus talks about worry and he talks about what you're going to wear what you're going to eat what you're going to drink and worrying about tomorrow a lot of us are like nine and eight me I ain't even worried about that because we live in a first world we got first world problems y'all hello somebody we don't live in a third well I ain't even worried about it y'all we're going to pray for that Guatemala team here's some money to go help some people but y'all deal with it I'm over I got first world problems I don't even down on the I'm worried about the Starbucks line moving quick enough so I can get my latte to get to work in the morning I'm praying for the parking space at tarjet y'all can I get one Jesus bless me with a front can I get that front row please you that's some of our first world problems y'all that we have inside of our life so when we read this we're like that's not even me I'm not even I'm not even worried about but can I tell you what Jesus is saying when you boil the scenarios down Jesus is dealing with the human dilemma that we all deal with and that is this that every single one of us are looking for a sense of security and survival no matter how that looks through century and generation over and over again we all want a sense of protection and self preservation and when I don't get it when I'm worried about losing it when it when it doesn't look like it's all going to go my way that's when I get the most worry anxiety and fear over money because I feel like the whole world and the whole weight of me having is up to my own human effort hello somebody oh I got to get it I got a grip tight of it I got a whole tight of it because if I don't if I don't grab a hold of it if I don't grab I'm not going to have it and so so I live in the I live in this thing if it's going to be it's up to me all this pressure is the pressure the worry the fear of what's going to happen in the future and all of that listen that calls is just the cycle of more anxiety fear and worry within our life and we live with the weight of how much pressure that is because it all depends on us so we grip it tightly but Jesus is bringing us in with this passage to tell us this watch this anxiety and fear over money is not just emotional it is theological I am questioning God's care will he provide I am questioning God's wisdom does he know what I need I am questioning God's power can he handle this can he come through with me so the worry and the fear over money over money is not a disbelief in God it is living as if God doesn't care now we are responsible we plan for the future we take care of ourselves and our family and those around us but we have to have a bigger thinking to understand that anxiety and fear over money is rooted in an unbelief God can't do it and it's up to me see the real issue of it all ladies and gentlemen is we have forgotten God's faithfulness we have forgotten that God is the provision God has all providence in our life and yet we are living like the universe is in our hands the real issue ladies and gentlemen is a trust issue inside of a heart who do you really rely on as your provider in life can I tell you you are not meant to be the source of your life you are not to provide just for you that you have a God that provides for you and I want to tell somebody today he can be trusted he can be believed in God will come through for you God will provide for you God never fails not because of you holding on the head but God's been holding on to you not because of your grip on him but God's grip on you the whole time that you have never seen then it comes to the heart of the passage I'm almost done no I'm not I am the heart of the passage in verse 33 but seek first the kingdom in his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well seek first meaning priority when you put God first as your priority all the other provision is going to begin to fall in place when you put God first as your priority in your life and you begin to loosen up your hands and live as if and work as if it depends on me but I live like it all depends on God and I simply steward he is the source of my life and I live with open hands the worry begins to lose its grip on you and the needs begin to be met inside of your life notice now notice now I said that God first God asked for priority that is a kingdom principle he is teaching us it is a kingdom principle not a prosperity gospel so don't believe that crazy TV preacher you keep hearing he's out of bounds biblically are you hearing me today because the kingdom principle of God first does not mean luxury it means sufficiency and when you get the principle right I'm telling you when you get the principle right when you get the principle right God first when you get the principle right everything else in your life falls into place it's the principle of the first now this might be foreign to many of us and it might be strange because maybe maybe this is a new concept maybe you're new to Christ and this is you've never been taught anything like you didn't know anything like what in the world is going on but I have seen it with my eyes as I have lived in a pastor's home and I have followed parents that lived Christ first Christ as priority Christ above all and seen how God took care of them their whole lives my wife has watched it with her parents as God first God as priority and God is taking care of them all of their life this is a kingdom principle that we've got to put into place inside of our lives because when you do that everything falls into place God first God first in my aspirations my goals my dreams God first in my ambitions and my desires God first in my finances and when God is first everything else begins to fall into place not kingdom second because whenever whenever you seek money first it's never going to be enough and that's why you feel miserable and worried about it so much kingdom first Jesus first his priorities first for your life because what you said is first puts everything else in its place so if his kingdom should be our priority what is his kingdom all about his kingdom's about his glory his kingdom is about his rule and reign in this earth his kingdom is about redeeming humanity unto himself you see his kingdom can be what he's doing in the earth right now establishing his reign in the earth he's all about his priority his heart what matters most to him can really be don't bowl down to two things are you ready the lost and the least the lost in the least Jesus himself said in Luke chapter 19 verse 10 for the son of man came to seek and to save that which is lost in the book of Matthew Jesus says this or Matthew chapter 25 verse 40 the king replies talking about a parable here truly I tell you whatever you do for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine you do to me so our priority and our principal here to manual every year we do this we kind of reevaluate why we do what we do are we focused on kingdom first is our priorities and our principles here at manual not just as the greater corporate body as the church but individually for you personally is it is kingdom part of your priority don't tell me what your mouth show me there should be evidence for all of us including the pastor on stage of what we value the most in our lives and so we spend this time talking about vision of where God is leading us where he's calling us to how we're going to reach the lost and the least and we begin to give for ministry expansion above what we normally give to see the kingdom of God go for we do this every February of re-evaluation of our priorities kingdom principles and where our heart is being drawn to the heart of God because here's what we believe what matters to him should matter to us his heart should be our heart and so every year this time of year we talk about what is called the one campaign the reason why we call it the one campaign is scriptural where Jesus said he left the 99 to go after the what the one that was lost the one that was least he left to go after it what are we willing to do to go run after that which is lost and that which is least to pursue the heart of God in ministry expansion to reach more people if we didn't do this it's a year-long campaign where we give above our normal giving to what's called the one campaign for ministry expansion the churches we have planted the global impact we have had comes not only out of what you give but also for ministry expansion we give to the one campaign and just last year alone we've wrapped up a year we raised over $250,000 for ministry expansion above our normal giving to the one campaign you're giving this year has made a lot of what we did the churches we've planted the things that we've done the people we have reached has come from your faithfulness and giving of making God a priority with your finances and it has made a major difference not only in this region but also an impact around the world last year we gave it a name we called it run this year we gave it a name we gave it three three names red letter way that's this year's name where we're really focusing on what Jesus says and I want to say thank you for what you gave to the one campaign in 2025 check out this two-minute video recap of what the one campaign did from this past year check this out hey church thank you for your generous giving to the one campaign in 2025 our word for the year was run and led by Hebrews 12 one we set out to run with perseverance the race marked out for us to reach people for Christ in our local communities and around the world the one campaign comes from the story found in scripture where the 99 sheep are left for the one and here at a manual church it is our heart to follow God and go after the one giving above and beyond our regular giving we are able to reach more and more people and expand ministry through the one campaign and because of your generosity we were able to raise 253,145 dollars in 2025 towards the advancement of ministry this year we made some significant upgrades to our campuses at the Bethany campus we invested in software and tech upgrades to improve the online experience and creating more reliable network connection between campuses this year we made some improvements to the building creating more gathering space in the foyer and building a new cafe making the space more welcoming to current members and first-time guests at central campus we made some much needed repairs and upgrades to our campus including a new roof on the building parking lot repairs ground maintenance and cleanup of the retention ponds this year we also made some security upgrades including new and additional security cameras and increased support personnel during Sunday services we also enhanced our in-person and online experience by updating our stage lighting in the sanctuary this year we made an impact in Guatemala by sending two medical missions teams and financial support to impact ministries as they preach the gospel and share God's love with people in Guatemala planting churches teaching giving food and caring for the elderly era is our Emmanuel residency program in 2025 we welcome two new residents to our team all of our residents have become integral parts of the staff have grown in the Lord learned in community and have sharpened their skills to further pursue God's calling on their lives so thank you for your generous giving to the one campaign in 2025 we look forward to your partnership in the coming year and we anticipate the great things that God will do amen it's awesome that brings us to where God is leading us for 2026 i'm so excited to share so many things with you the one campaign here's our normal giving and then over here we give to ministry expansion everybody get this so those that have been coming for a while you know how we do it's very pivotal and important and impactful for ministry one of the things that we've been wanting to do is plant the next missional church that's going to look different than anything else we've planted at different places and spaces and made it look different but one of those things that we've always wanted to do is come back when the time was right to plant over on Benny Street kind of let me kind of give you a little perspective on what's happening some of you know it's through the one campaign you're giving through the one campaign uh that we were able several years ago the adoptable ministry our outreach ministry that just started with a few homes that we went knocked on door and handed boxes of food to just started with a few houses one block turn into multiple blocks turn into hundreds of homes homes where we were able to not only give food but we were able to win people to the Lord we've given furniture away beds away uh I mean just an amazing form of ministry we've seen people touched in so many ways and we had this dream what would it look like if we were able to put a facility in the heart of the community and so we did that through your faith will give you all remember y'all been here some of y'all were here since 2020 and we found the building just off of church tree called on Benny Street which was the old uh color i culligan's water station wasn't it and it was uh and it was just the old dilapidated rundown building and uh they were like you want this building yes we want this building and because of your giving we were able to purchase the property renovate it and build a 5,000 square foot building off the back because if you're giving for three or four years we are able to build a uh over one million dollar building to give to the way to the heart of community give yourselves a hand give yourselves a hand for that that's what we're able to do the last several years and so the adopt the block has been operating out of there the last year or so and it's taken a while to get the thing up and going and so there was delay should we plant no it's not time yet no it's not time yet but we believe the time is now for us to finally plant the church at Benny the church at Benny here is the premise don't just go to church be the church it's the church at Benny that's gonna look different it's a mission church that looks different than anything we have ever done before it's not gonna be on a Sunday morning it's gonna be on a Saturday morning and we might not have worship y'all you know what we will have we're gonna have the church ready to serve people with a hot breakfast and we're gonna call on many of you to cook breakfast and to serve people and to love the community as they come in and you know what we're gonna do more than anything here's the thing we are going to preach the gospel to people that need to hear the hope of the message of transforming power of Jesus Christ on a Saturday morning and we're gonna give them the hope of Jesus and we're gonna call on many of you this spring here in several weeks to be a part of it to cook breakfast to work with the kids to love people to serve them to sit at tables with them to love them and then when we are done we're gonna give them food as they exit and leave for the day what a great way and a demonstration to show the hands and feet of Jesus I'm so excited that Pastor Mark Thompson and his beautiful wife Felicia are gonna be leading that charge it's gonna be amazing it's gonna be amazing and so now the church at Benny is gonna happen and we are so excited about that the second thing is continued improvements on our campus and expansion and improvements listen what we do even at Bethany campus can't survive without you right now it's still getting itself together so you're giving makes a significant difference in every campus every place and space we plant is a form of an expression of what the church should look like it's not all gonna look like this yes it's gonna look different at each place in location so you're willingness to give to the one campaign make sure that they are able and capable to do ministry day in and day out at every campus that we have central campus this year right here we want to make sure that we continue to create a warm welcoming environment where we invest in the next generation where we invest in the kids coming up behind us where we invest in people growing in their faith and flourishing in discipleship so we want to create an environment continued here at Central as a house of worship in a place that continues to invest itself there are work there's projects we have to do over in our APC which is our gathering place next door where a lot of our small groups meet if you've been over there you know you know y'all it needs some serious updating the bathrooms have to be renovated we've got more parking lot repair lists and last year we wanted to dive into a parking lot expansion you know what I love and I hate all at the same time is watching many of you park on the grass and have to walk in the mud when it rains because sometimes we're four five rows deep in the grass beyond the parking lot and we tried to look into that and it was astronomical what it would take to actually expand our park it was crazy so we need to continue to be to make improvements here with our parking lot with with ceiling and protecting and ways in which we can expand and stay in parameters that that it's not gonna be an astronomical price to us last year we had to get the roof repaired and so we stuck to that so there's all kinds of of other things in there we're gonna invest in technology of reaching people listen the technology is the front door of the church today people how many would agree you check it out online before you check it out in building right and so we want to continue to invest we're reaching people all across the world all kinds of different states they tell me we have over 10,000 YouTube subscribers I don't even know what that means but it means something I don't even know what that means and so we're reaching a lot of different people through our line and we want to continue to invest in those things number four is our era program our era program is our residency program where we give young people an opportunity who feel called to ministry a lot of young adults get out and say I feel this pull from God but I don't even know what to do with it so we created a two-year residency program where they come on staff with us we develop them in leadership ability they get to do ministry every day now I wish I had that look when I got out of Bible college man ain't nobody tell me ain't nobody tell me a lot of things about ministry I didn't have practical things I had theological but not practical and so we allow them to two years where we train them not only in the word but we train them with what ministry actually looks like and you're giving helps that program continue on and the last thing is our global missions impact where we just don't want to be about a neighborhood one neighborhood but we want to be about all neighborhoods all across the world so we continue to invest in Guatemala as teams go over we love to support the ministry that is planting churches feeding the hungry with impacto ministries and I'm telling you it is something about when we go over to Guatemala and we see change lies but you know what it really does it changes our perspective about what God is doing around the world so this is what it looks like today there's a card in front of your information table I want you to take that we are in front of your the information card connection card just behind that I'm sorry just behind it you can find a one campaign card our goal this year we raised 253,000 but we want to raise 300,000 dollars this year this is how it works a minimum of 577 units giving additional $10 above their time each week for one year so this is your normal giving this is what you normally give your time and offering or your time then you give over here what's called the one campaign every week you just put in your memo and your check just put one 10 extra dollars a week now if you do that for 52 Sundays a year what is that $522 very good some of us can do one unit some of us can do five units I've seen people do 10 units is not equal giving it's equal sacrifice when we all partner together according to the means of which he has gives us that ministry expands expansion can grow so what we do is we commit to that for one year and then on March 1st Sunday March 1st now this is a lot shorter time frame than we normally do some of you know every year we probably give four or five Sundays to talk through but we've shortened this now to about three weeks and included in in the red letter way so on Sunday March 1st we want you to pray about it we want you to bring these cards back on March 1st you're gonna be able to find them online too and as we pray about it what we're gonna give we're gonna have a time where I'm gonna preach the word on March 1st we're gonna celebrate and then there'll be a time where we commit this before the Lord some of you might be saying well you know the whole year thing that I just want to I just want to do it all and once lump one lump sum give it done for the year you can do it on that Sunday March and we're gonna pray and we're gonna see God take it use it and multiply it for ministry expansion do you believe God is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all we ask think or imagine according to the power is it working us and we're gonna give back to God and see him do amazing things through it do you believe that that's a lot I said today when you agree but there's something powerful when the people of God put him first we get to participate on the kingdom of God kingdom of heaven happening here and now let's invest in something that has real value would you stand to your feet I want to pray for you today holy spirit I thank you for your church what we said today I know is a lot for many of us to take in but God I'm asking that what was said today the preaching of the truth of your word would land on hearts would land on hearts today that are fertile soil let it sink would you do business with us this week God would you challenge the church all of us on our priorities and do we put you first in every area of our lives would you help us God to think about how we all can participate to see the expansion of your ministry go for whether it be church planning whether it be projects whether it be participating in missions across the world we all get to be a part of that I hope us to see our place in it all we love you today thank you for your church your faithfulness to your people be with us as we go our separate ways Jesus name thank you
