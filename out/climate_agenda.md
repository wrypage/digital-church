## Elias (signal → meaning)
**1.** (observation) We keep opening the Word with seriousness right now. And John keeps showing up—not as decoration, but as weight. Listen to how it comes out in plain language:

**Receipts:**
> concern that there is deviation going on, falling away, departure from the faith because of deception. That brings us to our text. 2 Timothy chapter 4, beginning in verse 1. I charge you, therefore, before God and the Lord Jesus…

**2.** (interpretation) There’s a sobriety in the room. We’re hearing warning language—not to scare people, but because shepherds don’t want their people drifting. Listen to how it comes out in plain language:

**Receipts:**
> so that there is no house no harbor from the land of Cyprus it is revealed to them he's been dealing with several different nations several different countries that will experience the judgment of God as a result of the…

**3.** (interpretation) A lot of messages are entering through story and lived experience—and then moving toward Scripture. That can be beautiful. It can also be a shortcut. The difference is whether the story bows to the Word. Listen to how it comes out in plain language:

**Receipts:**
> Now of course the prophets wore, prophets like Isaiah wore these skins, the camel skins, and with the bristle inside and usually wore a tunic underneath that. I remember when David was dancing before the Lord when they were bringing…

**Closing:** Conviction without assurance has a predictable outcome in the human heart.
