tell you what, it was awesome last week to be able to join together online as the church, but I don't like doing that. Can I just be honest with you? I love, I know disrespect of online. Let's give everybody a hand to swatch an online. But there's nothing quite like being in God's house, yes. And so last week it was so funny, people were like, Emmanuel, never cancels ever. And we have it. We've canceled in person service maybe twice, maybe in the last 15 years, y'all. But it was the frozen rain. We didn't know what was going to happen. So with the online platform, we decided to do it last week. And let's just be honest, Mother Nature has been straight up disrespectful lately. You know what I mean? Good thing we are starting on forgiving because it feels like Mother Nature just plumbed slap this right into face y'all. And I'm having issues with unforgiveness inside of my heart towards her. So we got to pray. We need to pray for that today. So thank you for joining us today. Thank you for coming out in this bitter cold. And y'all came. Look around. This is pretty good for minus 20 degrees, y'all. Because you know how us Eastern Shore people do. You know what I mean? One snowflake or as a little bit of cold is like, I'm nestling up in my blanket on the couch. So thank you for joining us today. Hey, we're in the middle of a series called the Red Letter Way. Have you enjoyed this series y'all? Yeah, where we're focusing the next several months, we're praying that it changes the trajectory of our church where we're looking at what Jesus said in scripture. The five things that he focused on the most and letting them transform us on the inside and then produce what God wants to do through us on the outside. And so we just finished our first section on being with God over the last several weeks. Have you been enjoying the devotionals that go along with it? Yes? Hey, keep your eyes out online. Those devotionals dropped tomorrow for our next word today. The second thing that Jesus focused on more than anything. He focused on the word forgiving. Now I'm going to be honest with you guys. The next several weeks are going to be hard for us. Can we do hard? Yes? How many are mature enough to do hard? Yes? How many want the truth? You don't want fluff and cupcake and come on. How many came to church today because you didn't want three points and a poem? And send you on your way. How many want the truth and transparency of God's word? That transforms. Yes? And so that's what we're going to be doing the next several weeks as we dig into our next two words on forgiving and giving. It's going to be great. Make sure once again you tune in. Go read the devotionals. It's a great tool for us to engage in God's work. But today we're going to start this series on forgiving. We're going to pray over it in just a second and we're going to ask God to bless it because we're going to be dealing with some really hard topics over the next couple of weeks. So John chapter 8 today is where we're going to start starting at verse 2. And if you have it, say go. The word of God for the people of God. It says this. At dawn speaking of Jesus, he appeared again in the temple courts where all the people gathered around him and he sat down to teach them. The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group. Everybody say stand. They made her stand before the group and said to Jesus, teacher, this woman was called in the act of adultery. In the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say? They were using this question as a trap in order to have a basis of accusing him. But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, let any one of you who is without sin be the first one to throw a stone at her. Again, he stooped down. Everybody say stooped. He stooped down and wrote on the ground. At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first until only Jesus was left. With women still standing there, Jesus straightened up and asked her, woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you? No one's there, she said. And neither do I condemn you, Jesus declared, go now and leave your life of sin. Bless the reading of God's word today, man. I want to speak to you the next few minutes, a message entitled, tracking in the dirt, tracking in the dirt, Holy Spirit, settle on us in this moment. Deal with our hearts today. Some of us have had all we could do to get to church today. One time, kids is crazy. Kids don't want go nowhere. It's cold. I'd rather sit in the house, but something stirred their spirit to get them here today. So I know that you want to meet with us in a special way and a special moment in this hour. Speak to us now as only you can. Aluminate your word. Give me the words to say, let it come from you and Jesus' name. And the people of God said, come on in the people of God said, ask your neighbor this question. Do you do dirt? Ask them. Do you do dirt? I was wondering, do you do dirt? Do you like dirt? Let me ask that question. Do you like dirt? And you may be seated in the presence of God today. I brought something with me for this illustration this morning that is something that we have around our house. Matter of fact, we have multiple of these around our house. Anybody have one of these? Around your house. How many have multiple one of these? How many have a vacuum? I hope you raise your hand and you do some form of cleaning or tidying up around your house. We have multiple of these. This one looks like it's got some work. You all look at that thing. You see how that's all. Lopsided kind of looks like my hair this morning. It's got a nice pomp door to it. We have multiple of these because we have five children and you know what happens with five kids, right? Dirty is just what happens when you have five children. It can happen in the kitchen. It can happen in the living room. It can happen in nooks and crannies in our sunroom out back where they love to get the chips, to sneak them out back. They know they're not supposed to be eating in there, but they do it in any way. They get to test it. What are they called? Toastitos. That's right. They get to testitos and the Doritos and all of those things to eat. So they leave stuff everywhere. But one of the things that they do is they love tracking it. They don't love it. It kind of happens. It just tracks all over the house. There's dirt everywhere sometimes. And that's why in the back of our house, near the back door, it seems like a mountain of shoes because we kind of have this rule. You got to take your shoes off before you go into house because you're going to track into what? Come on somebody, you're going to track into what? You're going to track in the dirt and we can literally trace you every step that you go by the dirt that you've made. You just kind of follow it and it will take you to the person most of the time. That's guilty. Now when you have no shoes on, a clean feet or clean shoes and you walk through the house, there is no remit. There is no way of knowing any of those things because there's not dirt anywhere. But when the kids start walking around with dirt, you know who is the one. Now one time I walked in and there was dirt down the hallway. It was traced through the kitchen and down the hallway and I'm like, what in the world? I mean literally it was like clumps of dirt in the house. What in the world is happening? And so my son comes around the corner and he's looking at me because I'm looking at him like you are the guilty party. All of this stuff has got to be you and he's looking at me with this dumbfounded face like what's wrong with you? I look down. The dude has baseball cleats on. Walking around the house and I'm like, what do you mean what's wrong with me? You tracked in the dirt all across the house and you know what he said? It wasn't me. That dirt ain't me. I'm like, look down dude. The dirt comes from you. You tracked it in the house and I literally traced it to your room. It is your fault. He can't help it. It just comes with the territory when you kind of get dirty. Everybody say dirty. When you get dirty, it just kind of leaves the trail. It leaves the track. You can trace it wherever you go. And the reason why I tell you that this morning is no matter who you are, no matter where you come from, no matter what age, race, ethnicity, nationality that you come from, we all have this core idea in common and that is this. We all have some dirt. Come on somebody. Now you may portray perfect on the surface like you've got everything together but if you get past the façade beneath the surface level you will see with all of this life has not been perfect. Every single one of us. We all have a past that we are not proud of. We've all participated in things that have not been perfect. Life at times has not been pretty. Let's be honest by a show of hands have you ever made a dumb decision before? Okay. Those that don't have their hands up, they are lying. That is a dumb decision so raise your hand. Every single one of us, we've made dumb decisions and things that we've not been proud of. A lot of us have been connected to wrong relationships and questionable relationships that we know are wrong but yet we still stay connected to them. Those of us have been hooked on bad habits or have been addicted to some sort. It might not just have been drugs and alcohol maybe it's social media and you've said and done some stupid stuff on social media and it goes on and on and on and no matter how much we try to make over it and make it look pretty underneath it all. There is a mess. There is some dirt because we all got some dirt. And the thing is about dirt is it has a way of tracking our past. No matter how much we try to get rid of it, no matter how much we try to sweep it under the rug, no matter how much we try to wash it off of us or wipe it off of us, it seems like it is traced through every part, every segment of our life and we can't clean it up. I can't get away from it. It is everywhere I turn. It's everywhere I go. It's the things that I face in my life and because of the dirt there are many of us that have a sense of shame, a sense of guilt, a sense of regret, a sense of condemnation inside of our lives because we feel dirty. I want to draw your attention today to John chapter 8 before we even get into the sermon. I believe there are some important parts that are so applicable before we even jump into the message that I want you to get today. In John chapter 8, if you actually have a tangible Bible and you can see it inside the scriptures, you will notice that it is a little bit different than anything else that you will read. The reason being, as you look at it, you will see it has some brackets around it, it is in italics, it looks a little bit different. The reason being is because you will notice above the section you will read that this story was actually left out of the early manuscripts. The manuscripts did not originally have this story and many scholars believe because of the oral tradition that went along with this and it was very congruent with Jesus' character and his nature that it made its way inside of John, but in the original translation, it was left out. Everybody say left out. Now I want you to hold that thought left out and see inside the story, it says that this woman watches this woman, who was she? She was a woman. What was her name? We don't know her name. She was a woman caught in the act of adultery. Now notice they never mentioned her name. She literally is identified by her dirt. She was identified by what she did. Now you take those two things and you put them together and you can see that this is the place many people feel when it pertains to the dirt inside of their life because there are many within the sound of my voice that because of your dirt you feel left out. You feel ashamed. You feel like people don't include you anymore. They know your past. They know where you come from. They know what you participated in. So there is no room for you. Nobody cares about me. Nobody listens to me. Nobody includes me. They know my history. They know my dirt and so they keep a distance. They leave me out. Somebody say left out. But then there are others of us that feel like this woman and we feel like because of what we have done we have been defined by it. What I have participated in that's what I am known for. I am nothing but an alcoholic. I am nothing but this divorce. I am nothing but this difficulty or the shame or this trauma of what I have endured and gone through. I have been identified. I have been labeled by what I have done. And what we must understand this morning before we even move forward is that the greatest trick of the enemy is to always use your track record for you to determine what you have done. Watch this. I am left out and I am defined by. I am left out and I am defined by. This is what the enemy uses to trick you into thinking that there is a limitation for you that you cannot receive God's grace. You can never be forgiven in your life. You can never move forward into a greater purpose because of your past. And many people stay stuck. I am left out or defined by. And so before we can ever move on with this series talking about how do we forgive the people that have hurt us in our life. I think it's important that we first start with this. How do we forgive ourselves? Because how in the world can you ever forgive anybody else if you haven't received forgiveness for you? Jesus said something interesting over in the book of Matthew or book of Mark chapter 12, verse 30. Watch what Jesus, his word said. Love the Lord your God. He's talking about which is the greatest commandment. He's answering a question here. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength. And the second is this. Watch this. This is what I want you to see. And love your neighbor as yourself. Listen. How can you love your neighbor as yourself if you don't love yourself? And this is where a lot of people sit inside of this room. I don't love me because of what I've done. I don't love me because of my past. I don't love me because of who I feel like I am insecure, hopeless and helpless, purposeless because of the past and reading life through a sense of set of lenses or a narrative that we have gotten all wrong and we live in shame, guilt, regret and condemnation inside of our life. That's where many people are today. There's not anything out of this yet. So Jesus is dealing with a woman that I'm sure felt exactly the same way. Like many of you feel inside this room and I want you to see something inside the scriptures. John chapter 8 verses 3 through 6. Check this out. The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in the act of adultery. They made her stand. Everybody say stand. They made her stand before the group and said to Jesus, teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. In the law of Moses commanded us to stone such a woman. Now what do you say? They were using this question as a trap in order to have a basis to accuse him. Now watch what is happening. They dragged this woman into the temple courts because she had been caught in the act of adultery. Now notice they make her stand before everybody in order for them to see full blame, full accusation, to make her feel some kind of way in front of everyone to feel exposed and embarrassed by her dirt. But they catch her and they stand her out, stand her up. But watch why they do it. They don't do it to help her. They do it to try to trick Jesus because the law of Moses, the Old Testament, religious law of the day says that anyone that is caught in the act of adultery, the demand and the penalty was death by stony. So they asked Jesus as they stand her up, hey Jesus, what do you say that we should do with this woman? So what they are trying to do? Watch this. Jesus says to stone the woman, then Jesus would actually be violating the Roman law of the day which did not give the Jews permission to have their own execution. But if Jesus was to say do not stone her, then he would be violating the religious law of the day that Moses gave so you can see what's happening here. If you get beneath the surface, you can see what they are actually doing. And if you don't notice, let me give it to you by one simple question, watch this. Where is the man? Where's the man at? Because if you read the Old Testament and this law that demands death by adultery, you will see that both parties were to pursue, to be punished. But it seems like to me there is only one party standing here. So if they really wanted real justice, then the man wouldn't be missing. But he is. He tells us there is a deeper issue that is happening inside the text and that is this. They want to trap Jesus. They want to accuse him just like they are accusing the woman. They want to test him to try to get him caught up in something. And so they create this scenario to trap him. But what I find interesting is this, the interesting part of the text is how they are so quick to point out and call out this woman's dirt, but yet they don't even recognize their own. They are complete willingness and their own hypocrisy to use the law to accuse the woman, but they don't even see they are accused themselves. That's the first thing I want to talk to you about today. I want to talk to you about it's a trap. It's a trap. Say that with me on 3, 1, 2, 3. It's a trap, y'all. What amazes me about so many people is how quick we are to call out their dirt, but yet there is a complete refusal or a recognition to see the dirt inside of ourselves. Isn't it interesting? And what we do is we become almost like a modern form of Pharisee that the woman had to deal with, where we want to stand people up and pick them apart. Have you ever seen people like that before? Hello, somebody. Or maybe that you inside of your own life. Maybe you are like that today. We love to stand people up and catch them in the act, trying to catch people in the act, fully expose them, fully embarrass them, fully condemn them for what they have done. Now it's not like you are telling lies. It's not like you are using the truth because what sometimes we say is the truth. The problem is we use the truth as a weapon to cut people down. We shoot people with our own struggles. We stab them in the back all the while saying, oh yeah, yeah, I know the truth about you. I know your track record. Why don't I put you on display in front of everybody to share your dirt all the while. The reason why we love to call out people's dirt is because it disguises the dirt that we have. We'd rather get the eyes off of us and put it on other people to make ourselves feel better at times. I am preaching on this cold winter day today. But it's a trap. Say it's a trap. It's a trap because here's the thing. Nobody gets healed. Nobody gets helped when we live in the hypocrisy of our own humanity. And all we want to do is condemn others but ignore our own guilt. Expose others but never self-examine us ourselves. How quick so many Christians are so quick to quote scripture but yet we quietly disobey the very thing that we quote. Living in total denial. That we even got any dirt but always can discern the dirt in everybody else. Jesus talks about that over in the book of Matthew. I'm coming for you now. Here it comes. Matthew chapter 7 verse 3. It says this. Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, let me take the speck out of your eye when all the time there was a plank in your own eye? You hypocritz. First take the plank out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye. Here can I break it down for you? Don't be so quick to call out everybody else's dirt and not see it within your own self because the real danger of the dirt is not being a sinner. It's being blinded to your own sin. I know the truth about them. Well you got a truth about you. Come on somebody. Look it is getting hot in here. It's cold but it's getting hot. Find three people around you and nudge them real good and tell them it's the truth. It's the truth. It's the truth. It's the truth. It's the truth. Don't weaponize the truth to escape the verdict of what's happening inside of your own heart and that's what's happening here. Take the eyes off of us and put it on this woman. Let's trap Jesus. Let's not look at ourselves and watch what Jesus does. I love how Jesus responds in verse six. But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. And they kept on questioning him. He straightened up and he said to them, let any of one of you who is without sin be the first one to throw a stone at her. Again, watch what did he do? He stooped. I love that. He stooped down and wrote on the ground. At this those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first until Jesus was left with a woman still standing there. I love it. See what's happening? Jesus does something that we could not even predict. Jesus goes, watch this from standing to stooping. Jesus gets down and bends down in the dirt and he begins to write inside of the dirt. Now many scholars believe because we don't know what Jesus wrote. The scriptures don't say. So the common fault and theory from most scholars is that when they began to write in the dirt that Jesus was writing the names and the sins of those who came with stones inside their hands. When Jesus straightens up and looks at them and says, let the one who is without sin cast the first stone, you know what Jesus is doing? I love it. I love it. Because remember it's a trap. They're trying to question him. What will he answer? How can we accuse him? And Jesus is doing it this way. He is not denying the law. He's turning the law back on them. Jesus is if he's forcing them to look at their own self. So now all of a sudden the law that they use to condemn the woman is the same law that accuses the accusers. So if you got sin, come on and cast that first stone. And the Bible says that they began to drop the stones in the rocks and walk away one by one until the only one that's left. The only one that's left is the one who had no dirt, who had no dirt, no sin, the only one that could throw a stone and that was Jesus himself. But watch this. Jesus did not throw a stone at her. Jesus got down in the dirt with her. Jesus stooped down not to throw stones. Jesus got down in the dirt not to give her what she deserved. Jesus got down in the dirt to give her grace and to lift her up to a life of forgiveness. That's the second thing I want to tell you now I'm getting happy now, y'all. Oh yeah, the Starbucks kicked in now. I came to tell you my point to grace gets you up. You'll say it with me. Grace gets you up. Did you know that in scripture many times when it talks about the enemy Satan that comes against us all, the name of him according to the book of Revelation chapter 12, it says that he is the accuser of the brethren. That means that he comes to you in your life to throw stones like accusations. He throws his accusations at you. So you remember what you did. You remember what you were part of. You remember what you were before. He keeps throwing the dirt at you. You got dirt. You got dirt. You got dirt. But the next time he begins to throw the rocks of accusations, I want some people to remember that when he throws the accusations, you can tell him you throw stones, but God gets down in my dirt. God has got down in my dirt. And God gets down. He stooped down low, not to throw stones, but to give us grace to lift us up again. Because grace is not your self up. Grace is God came to where you were to give you grace to lift you up into a life of forgiveness. Grace is not the excuse of sin. Grace is Jesus stooping down and stepping in to your execution. Because the Bible says that none of us are righteous, no not one. All it falls short of the glory of God, that we deserve death by the penalty of our sin, but he came down to where we were, gave us the grace to lift us up again. Somebody say, Grace, it is the grace of God. You are loved. You are forgiven. You are redeemed. You are not your past because grace stands in you up. Grace gets you up. Grace does not keep you where shame puts you. Grace stands you up. Grace somebody say stand up. Stand up. Come on say stand up. Stand up today. Come on, I'm talking to somebody today. Hey honey, hey sweetheart, you're not a tramp. You're not a whore. You're not used goods. You are what God says you are. You are forgiven. Get up by God's grace. Don't stay down, get up. You are forgiven. Hey business man, you cheated. You lied. But that was your past. You know Jesus now, get up. Get up. Stand up. You were addicted. You're not addicted anymore. Stand up by God's grace. You are forgiven. Have I come down your street yet? Have I come down your street yet? I will if you want me to. God's grace. Get you up. I love it. Watch what happens in verse 9. At this dose who heard begin to walk away, the older ones first until who was left, Jesus with who, with the woman still standing there. Jesus straightened up and asked her, woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you, verse 11, I love it. No one, sir. She said, then neither do I condemn you. Notice what Jesus does. He goes from standing to stuping, to standing again. And he tells the woman, look at who's left. Look around you, who's left, who's left? Is there anybody left standing with you? Is there anyone left after it's all done? Is there anyone left that condemned you and as she looks around, there is no one left. Is just her and Jesus and the one who was left is the one who saved her. He did not throw stones at her. Can I tell you today, this is the perfect picture and depiction of the gospel message I want you to get today of God's grace, that our Savior in heaven, seated at the right hand of the Father, saw the dilemma of the destruction of the dirt down in humanity and was not satisfied to keep us in the slum of our own mess. So Jesus stood up from the balconies of heaven and stooped down to the symphonies of humanity. God got down in our dirt and wrongly accused and crucified on the cross. He was laid in a borrowed tomb in the dirt, but I'm so glad it didn't end there. On the third day, he was raised to life and he went from standing to stuping, to standing again full of life, snatched up death, hell in the grave and has the keys in his hands, all to extend grace to you today. He is standing so you can stand too. He came and got up to give you grace and I believe Jesus is asking many of you the same question today because if you'd look around, you'd see quit looking at all the haters in your life and start looking at the one that's left because if you'd look around, you'll see Jesus is the one standing there with you. Come anything in your life when others leave and walk away for your own demise, your own dirt. There's only one who's been standing there the whole time. Look around you today. Is there anyone left that can speak into your future? Is there anyone left that created your life and knows every hair on your head? Is there anyone left that says, I know the plans I have for you, the Clare's the Lord, plans the props for you and not to harm you, plans for hope in the future. Is there anyone left if you'd look around you today? You'd see it's just you and Jesus and your response would be the same as this woman. There is no one left. There is no one here. There is no one left to condemn. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. It is the grace of God. This is grace. Grace is just you and Jesus. Standing when nobody else is left. Amen. The sinner stands alone with Jesus. Fully redeemed, fully restored by Jesus and Jesus alone. The book of Romans chapter 8, Paul says it this way. Therefore, there is now no condemnation. No condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. Because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death. No condemnation. No guilt. No shame. Can I tell someone today it's time to stand tall. Straighten up today. You don't have to hang your head in shame and in guilt and in condemnation for what you have done, God's grace is the one who stands you up today and you are forgiven. You are forgiven. Can I say it one more time today until you get into your Spirit? You are forgiven. You are forgiven. You gonna walk away from this army like I don't hear one thing, I ain't hear nothing about all that. He was going standing stoop and all I remember was you. Now I wish somebody would stand to your feet right now. Look around you right now. Look all around you. We ain't done yet. Don't put your jacket on. We ain't going nowhere. Look around you today. Look around and say, ain't nobody left. Ain't nobody left. Ain't nobody left. Ain't nobody. Ain't nobody left. They're people I have but ain't nobody left. Because this God's grace that stands me tall. It's God's grace that gets me up and now I am forgiven. Say it with me. I am. Stand a little bit taller today. I am forgiven. Come on, give God praise if you're forgiven. Give God praise if he restored your life and forgiven. You now you've got to receive. Look, receive, receive that truth today. You've got to walk in that truth. You can't just hear it with words in church but that's got to be the prayer. You pray every day when the stones start coming your way with accusations. You've got to stand on the truth of God's words. See what I did there? Stand on the truth of God's word and say no, no, no, no. I am forgiven. Sit down. I ain't done. Two more minutes and I'll have you out of here. If you got the remote starter, go ahead. Go ahead, get it warm. But I would be remiss not to add the last part. Verse 11. Verse 11, can you put it on the screen for me? Nope. Okay. It's not their fault, it's mine because the Lord has lead me all kinds of crazy ways today. Okay. No one's search, she said, and neither do I keep telling you Jesus declared, here it comes. Go now and leave your life of sin. Please hear me. Everybody with me. Are you tracking me today? Jesus does not condemn her, but Jesus doesn't also condone adultery. He forgives her sin, but he also doesn't excuse her sin. He gives grace, but he also says, go and leave your life of sin. He raises her up with grace, but also gives her the reality of the truth of that grace, saying, you have to give this life up. And that's the tension that we live in in our humanity. It's the tension of these two truths that happen all the time. It's grace and truth that happen, which is the true nature of who he is. That's the last thing I want to give you today. It's living in the two truths. The tension of two truths is grace and truth. Well, that seems kind of weird because grace and truth are supposed to be opposed from another, right? No, grace is truth. Grace is truth, y'all. It's grace and truth. It's the tension of living inside the heart of believer where I receive the truth of the reality that I am forgiven by God's grace. But yet have enough honesty with ourselves about the truth of the way, the life that we live. Because grace is not permission or excuse to continue to sin. Jesus forgives us first. Watch this, but truth calls us to a changed life. And this is the tension we live in inside the church today. It's the tension between truth and grace. You see, there's parts of the church that we live in that the pendulum swings one way where we become, where we become all truth and no grace. And that's why many walked away from the Lord a long time ago. And why you have a hard time coming back to church because you grew up in a sense of religious legalism where you have to wear this and you have to do this. And I know people that have been bound by all kinds of religious stuff and crap they learned. Can I say that? It's okay, right? We're all mature. All kinds of stuff that we've learned in our life, please keep your emails. It's okay. You don't have to worry about sin. I know. All kinds of stuff that we've gone through in life and what we've learned is religious stuff of legalism that says you are no good unless you do all of this stuff. And we are quick to tell everybody the truth about who they are. Always the truth. Just speak the truth. I'm just telling you the truth. Well, yeah, you are. But you have caused the spirit of legalism and lived in a sense of your own hypocrisy just like a Pharisee. But then there's another segment of the church that we have encountered today where we want, it's swung the other way, where we want all grace and no truth. Where now we've got a gospel that's consumerism. It's like, how can Christ help me? What can he do for me? I can live any way I want and do anything I want. And it's okay because God's grace forgives me. And so we just excuse. Any way we live, anything we want to do because we don't want the truth, we want all grace. So the tension in life we've got to live it is the tension of two truths. And that's what Jesus was. He was grace and truth. Matter of fact, in John 1 verse 14 when it gives the depiction and the description of who Jesus is, it says this. The word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only son, who came from the Father. Here it is, full of what? Not grace and grace, not truth and truth, grace and truth. So what we have to do in the heart of the believers is live in grace. And no, it's not a matter of what I have done that has earned my salvation or my righteousness. It's by the finished work of the cross. And I am forgiven of my past. I'm a new creature in Christ. It wasn't dependent on me. It was dependent upon Jesus' work on my behalf. That's the grace I receive and I live in them and live in that forgiveness. But at the same time, I also have to have the truth and the reality of the way of life I'm living because some of us receive the grace of God. And our life is still destructive because we keep living the same patterns over and over and over again. If you keep living destructive and you keep living in dirt, guess what you're going to feel like? So we have to receive the grace of God that's given to us, but at the same time, live in the truth of what we live in. We don't deny the reality, but ask God to come in and cover every part of it that we by His Holy Spirit would be able to live in the truth. And the Scripture says, it's the truth that sets you free. I want to leave you with this two thoughts. Number one, grace forgives your past, but truth directs your future. The second thing is this. Grace lifts you up. Truth shows you how to walk once you're standing. Let's be a people who live in the grace of God, who stand on the truth of God, but also on the grace as well. Would you stand to your feet this morning? Would you close your eyes for me this morning? How many could say would nobody look around and say, Pastor, this message was for me today? I'm glad I came out in the cold. Father, I pray for every person that feels the sense of man alive. I've got some dirt and it's been hard for me. Thankful for God that saw us at our lowest point of life in the dirt came to where we were. Anybody grateful for that today? Come on, anybody grateful for that today? The lowest point, how many by show of hands say, I remember my low point in life? Come on, I remember my low point. Let your mind take you back to the low point when you couldn't even find your way out of a wet paper bag. But yet the spirit of truth and grace came to where you were and said, now's the time to stand to your feet. The grace of God has been offered to you. Maybe you're not living in that truth today of the grace or maybe you refuse. You want to live in the grace but refuse the truth of the reality of the life you are now living. And it's hard for you to make the change. I pray for you right now. Holy Spirit, need us in this moment. God would you sweep by your spirit. Would you stoop down even right now by your spirit? Every pew of every heart. Check every heart. You know every person, they're not a stranger to you. They can't hide and cover the dirt it is exposed before you. And the beauty of your love is that you never left us. You've stayed with us every step of the way. You've stooped down. And you're standing on us up right now. God, I pray for people who feel of sense of condemnation and guilt and shame for what they have done in their past or the way they are living right now. They've got issues. They've got stuff they're dealing with. And they feel like, oh, I just feel this weight and I feel this inside of my heart. Father, I pray that they would release that thing to you. They would repent. They would confess their sins. They would lay them bare before Jesus. And then in return, they would receive the grace of God to stand on the truth of God and the grace of God that you love them. You have redeemed them. You have forgiven them. Because we recognize today, Lord, until we deal with the forgiveness of ourselves, we can never deal with forgiving other people who have wronged us. If you're here today, I want to give you a chance to encounter this God, this gospel. If you've never received Jesus into your heart before, maybe you've walked away and you feel like today is the day I want to come back today. I feel him stooping down in my dirt and lifting me up with his grace. With every head bowed and every eye closed, say today is the day where I want to give my life to Jesus. Would you shoot that hand up in the air? Would you shoot that hand up? Yes, yes. Thank you for those hands. Yeah, thank you. How many could say Pastor Mark, would you pray for me today? Because I still deal with issues of things that I have done, condemnation, accusations that come up. Could you raise your hand? Say that's me. That's me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Father, I thank you for every hand that's raised. Lord, I pray for the people that want to receive you now. Would you pray this prayer with me? As I say all the time, it is nothing special about the prayer. It's the posture of the heart when you pray it. Pray it with me. God, I come to you today. And I admit I have sinned. I'm dirty. I'm low. That is why I believe Jesus came to forgive me, to accept me, to love me. To die on my behalf, for the forgiveness of sins, to make me right with God. And now I confess, I repent, come into my heart in my life. In Jesus' name, Father, I pray for every person that prayed that prayer, the beginning, the start of standing, forgiven, set free. I pray for people that are also dealing with it every day in the life of a believer. We all deal with it. Help us, God, with your grace, to live, to live in that truth, to stand on that truth, but also help us see the reality of the way we live and feel convicted, not condemned, convicted. And need the truth of the power of God's Word to change us, to live the way you would have us live by the power of your Holy Spirit. Thank you for your people, their dedication, to get outside in this. Man, it's awful. Awful weather. Makes me want to move forward. Who's with me? It's cold down there too, I imagine. Thank you for the willingness to come outside in the elements. And I pray that they would receive this Word that would encourage them moving forward. Jesus' name, amen.
