Father God, we come before you. We thank you for your word. Again, we ask that you would open your word to our hearts of fresh. Lord, as we go through this opportunity for one generation of the church to hand to the next generation of the church, wisdom, understanding everything we need for life and godliness, we might now how to conduct ourselves within the household of God. I pray you'd use this book a first Timothy to transform our walk with you. You draw as close to your Lord, may we sense more of your presence, hear more of your still small voice in our hearts, perhaps Lord in this time, be more effective for what you desire to do through our lives than we've ever been before. So come and minister to your church through your word we pray in Jesus' name. Amen. First Timothy, man, do it one way. Okay. This is one of several prison epistles. Timothy, Titus, second Timothy, Fy, Lehman, all written by Paul while in prison, but also so too Ephesians, Philippians and Colossians. But not only did he write to certain churches, he also wrote to certain individuals. And so first Timothy is one of those early letters that he wrote during his imprisonment. And of course some of you are like, what's he doing in prison, how do you get there? So rather than just go through the book of Acts, let me sum up. How's that? So how many of you remember Paul in Acts 21 came to Jerusalem with alms that he had brought to bless the church when he got there James and the other said, hey, there's this sort of word out there on the street about you, you're teaching people of forsake Moses to turn away from basically the law of God and all that. And other were just sort of turning away from the Old Testament. And what are we going to do? So we've got these guys who made a vow, do us a favor, go with them, pay their expenses for their sacrifices. Be with them as they sanctify themselves, come to the end of the vow and everybody will know that this is untrue, that was said about you. And so doesn't tell us well that Paul thought it was a great thing, he did it. And there are almost the any pity, almost there. And some Jews, some Asia Minor, otherwise known to you and I as Turkey, claimed that Paul brought trophamous past that dividing wall from the court of the Gentiles into the court of the Jews only and to do that is a death penalty. And so they raised this riot saying he's brought a Gentile past the burial wall and it tells you in the book of Acts is they were going about to kill Paul. So they're just beating us not out of them, licensed the commander up in the fortress Antonia, seized the problem, comes running in, breaks the whole thing up, grabs Paul, brings him in, they're about to basically beat him and scourge him and he says, hey man, I'm a Roman. And so they bring him the next day in front of the sand, Hendren, Paul makes one statement, the whole thing erupts into a giant argument, they bring him back that night to the prison and word gets out that there's an assassination hit team that is going to make sure Paul's killed dead. Lices, here's about this. Mill the night sends them out, sends them up the Cessarri Amirotima there, the governor has his home. Paul gets there to meet Felix who's in charge at the time and Felix reading what's going on says we'll keep you here until Lices comes up. Well for about two years he's sitting there in Cessarria by the way this last trip to Israel we got to see the prison they had him and they found it. Yeah they just keep digging but that's in the side first service in here. So they get him there and Felix interesting guy, he steals Drusilla King of Grip the second sister who has dropped dead gorgeous, steals her seduces her away from her husband, makes her his own, Paul preaches the Felix about self-control, God's judgment which freaks him out. Any eventually gets recalled to Rome and Festus takes over, you know him as porquies Festus. How do you forget a name like that? Festus goes down to Jerusalem, see the Jews, take care of his governorship, they complain about Paul, they want him to come down so they can try him there because they want to kill him. Festus talks to Paul about it and says hey listen how about we go down and have this hearing in Jerusalem and Paul says listen buddy modern translation I'm at Cessar's judgment seat you can't deliver me to them as you well know that's it I appeal the Cessar and that's it all records are sealed everything's closed Paul gets put on a boat they head to Rome they get shipwrecked at Malta eventually they get on a boat and he arrives in Rome everybody's still with me. He is given to the captain of the guard and only a short period of time whereas there one the captain of the guard his name is Buris Afernis and he died in 62 which means Paul had to get the Rome by 61 to be in charge of the captain of the guard what does that mean to you? Well he probably then had all his troubles somewhere around like late 58 early 59 spends two years in Cessarria eventually gets there put under house arrest why is that important? Because most degree somewhere around 63 two years in Rome house arrest which is when he's writing these epistles most degree he had his appearance before Nero I'm gonna hear the Nero remember Nero starts with NN and Nuts starts with NN what do you think Paul did when he appeared before Nero? What he always did he preached it most degree and we have to wait till heaven most degree he was released well it was dismissed or whatever what is of interest and maybe he made it to Spain is after that audience with Nero Nero really began to be pretty unstable isn't that interesting? July 1964 AD Rome catches on fire 10 out of 14 districts damaged three completely destroyed the rumor is Nero set the fire because he wanted to break it down and rebuild it for his own glory now I know that sounds crazy have a world leader that would destroy an existing edifice and rebuild it for their own glory I know history is weird but that was the rumor Nero to deflect from himself blame the Christians starting to call them according to some historians arsonists and so that's 64 persecution begins to increase against the church Paul traveling many Phil perhaps arrested a tro-as now back under arrest we think somewhere in the 65 AD somewhere in that ballpark we know he is put to death by 68 AD because Nero dies mid 68 Paul would be be headed on the austrian way 65 67 somewhere there he gets arrested Nero's one had him put to death Nero dies not long after now back story and I'm killing you with history somebody very can already see your like twitching in 66 AD so 63 is out 64 a fire somewhere 65 67 he gets arrested but somewhere by 68 he's put to death 66 AD the Jews begin an uprising in Jerusalem again Sestia's galley has shows up surrounds Jerusalem's about to handle the problem and then for some crazy reason he withdraws the Christians seeing Jerusalem surrounded which Jesus warned in Luke's gospel left galley us in his retreat gets attacked which absolutely enraged the Romans and the Roman the Jewish uprising is now basically getting ahead of steam Nero dispatches the spasian and his son tightest to begin to deal with this Jewish uprising 68 Nero dies empire gets thrown in the chaos it settles down eventually the spasian becomes emperor the spasian leaves his son tightest in Jerusalem to deal with the Jewish problem which he does and destroys the city by 78 AD so that's what's happening in the background so Paul here is in his first house arrest he's writing while under house arrest and had he not been parked in cesarea for two years and in Rome for probably two years we most likely might not have had Ephesians and Philippians and Colossians and first and second Timothy and other things so sometimes when God sets you down and won't let you move he's got some other reason for doing it so that's sort of your backdrop so hopefully nobody was harmed by that chapter one verse one Paul how many have heard of him three of you Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the epitage try that that is to command interesting or to impose a command on someone once again I have to give you some history in chapter 6 they pick out seven deacons all of them is named Stephen he begins to preach and confound Jews from some of the northern territories they begin to argue with him finally they can't defeat him so they falsely accuse him the dragon from the sandhedrin gives him a fantastic history lesson with the big picture of gods and geosive first time you guys reject him second time you accept him gods and jimosas first time you guys reject him second time you accept him guess what God just sent you a son you rejected him you stiff necked and heart of heart that didn't go so well they drag him out and they stone him to death standing there watching the stuff so it doesn't get wiped as a man named soft tarsus who you know as poly apostle so enraged by this he begins to invade homes drag men and women out at night force them the blaspheme the name of Jesus putting them in prison finally gets letters from the chief priests with authority to go to Damascus he's on his way there to go get more of those Christians and Jesus drops him to his knees appears to him in a glory brighter than the new day Damascus son and says to him Saul why do you persecute me and yes who are you Lord I'm Jesus whom you persecute us well where do you go that one epitage he was commanded to become an apostle he's gonna go before kings and governors and he's gonna suffer for Jesus's sake and he did so that's how he became an apostle Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the imposed command there was really no other way to go but uncle on that one by the commandment of God our Savior yeah why not who's he writing to it's on both corners of your book Timothy that brings up the next question how did he meet Timothy after he becomes a believer solve tarcis now known as Paul he's there at church in Antioch in the area of Syria and he's there and there are others ministering and the Holy Spirit said separate Barnabas and Saul for the ministry have called them too and they laid hands on these guys and they sent them out and they went west the Cyprus they went all through there and then decide they go north to southern Turkey and of course it's the warmer season so they get to the coast and everybody there is nowhere conditioning they go up into the higher hills so they go up into hills they end up at another town called Antioch not in Syria but in Turkey there are more than one Antiochs they go in and they so preach in fact if you study it he's still material from Peter in the day of Pentecost see nothing new he's so preached that many Jews and Gentiles opened their hearts to Jesus and the Gentiles said man that was so amazing could you do it next week so that next Sabbath or in like Acts 14 now the whole city comes out and 13 into 14 and when did you see that all the city comes out to hear him but all the city doesn't come out to hear them they filled with envy began to blaspheme the name of Jesus contradict the things Paul's teaching and finally there in Acts 13 Paul and Barnabas waxed both that's old King Jimmy for let them have it and they said you know it's necessary that they preach the gospel first to you Jews but seeing you put it from yourselves and judge yourselves on worthy of eternal life Calvinists beware that's free will we're going to turn to the Gentiles the Gentiles gladly received and back to God's sovereignty as many as were deemed to life believed Acts 13 fantastic chapter well since they couldn't win any other way the Jews in the Antioch basically stirred up trouble so they had to flee to Iconum they get to Iconum they're preaching there and the Jews may I to I catch up at Iconum and they made the one classic blunder when they left the Antioch those Jews who chased them out they looked at them and went and they shook the dust off the clothes at them in case you don't know when a Jew leaves Gentile territory and enters into the holy land back in the day they would take the dust off of them because they didn't want to bring the Gentile dust into the file the holy land I'm telling you is what they did so when they shook the dust off in front of those Jews at Antioch they were saying you're worse than the Gentiles watching that they went that's how they started following them from there at Iconum they got the people at Iconum upset so they left there when they went to Lystra they get the Lystra God does an amazing miracle for a guy who's been crippled from birth they start thinking these guys are deities they're like no we're just guys we're preaching to the gospel and by the time the other ones caught up they convinced the people there had seen the miracle to stone Paul stones they stone them with stones they drank them out of the city all the disciples are looking at them they're all pretty much going I think he's dead he's all cut up from rocks probably got a few goose eggs on him and now in X 16 you learn that in that town of Lystra was a certain young man named Timothy whose mother was a Jew his father was a Gentile and Paul seeing the ministry and the gifting and the good reputation among those at Lystra and Iconium took him to come join his entourage had him circumcised in the case you didn't know chapter 14 is where he's stone chapter 16 is where he takes Timothy in chapter 15 is where it says you don't have to be circumcised to walk with Jesus how many are going wait a second but he just circumcised him how many how many yes none of you why circumcised Timothy because his mother's Jewish and everybody knows that kid came from that womb one-to-one relationship the dad you got to take his word for it but that woman birthed that kid and so he has a Jewish heritage and if he's on circumcised Jews would view him as an apostate and you're going to tell me about the scriptures now I know what you're thinking how would they even know how many have gone with us to Israel raise your hands put him up high so they can see how many are remembering when we sent you into sit on the marble slabs at Betshan two little marble slabs a whole bunch it is a public bathroom none of these lame barriers next to you you're literally cheek to cheek sitting there on these marble two lay you know two lay it looks like this two marble outcroppings with a swap between them and so and their co-ed you should see the reaction the people who send them down there and they're all happy and they're sitting there and they're like this they don't know what they're doing right and then we eventually start explaining they're in a public who train and you can see they're all like you by the way in the winter when it's cold you send your servant to sit on the marble and heat it for you talk about a bad job so I don't mean to be rude but if you're uncircumcised it's going to be obvious no matter how discreet you try to be so we had him circumcised Timothy most likely there in that group staring at Paul who has got lacerations all over him blood in the dust who suddenly stands up and goes back into the same town that's probably one of the first major impressions Paul made on Timothy great Paul and Apostle settled that one of Jesus Christ by the epitage the imposed command of God our Savior oh man you know Swanson you keep this up you're never gonna know hold on God our Savior and our Lord Jesus Christ God our Savior is our Lord Jesus Christ wait but that means yes a meanger in Genesis 22 waiting for me enough history let's let you work your bibles out Genesis 22 Abraham's told to take his son his only son Isaac you can work through that later to a place will show him they go to Mount Mariah you know it now is where the temple sits and ultimately at the top Calvary or Goghotha occurred as he's heading up the hill Isaac verse 7 who's an adult not a little precious moments kid I'd well have to disparage that visual Isaac speaks to Abraham as father of verse 7 and he says my father and he said here I am my son well behold we've got the fire we've got the wood where's the lamp for burn offering love King James Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb boy is that a pregnant statement God will provide himself a lamb then verse 14 after the ramps caught in the thicket Abraham gives another half prophecy he called in name that place Jehovah gyra God will provide and he said as it has said this day in the mount of the Lord it shall be seen put him together God will provide himself a lamb and what do you know on the very same hill Jesus would be crucified the mount of the Lord it shall be seen Genesis 49 Joseph is or Jacob is on his deathbed more correctly as he's on his deathbed he prophesies over his sons and he gets to Judah and he says in chapter 49 verse 10 this scepter shall not depart from Judah a ruler nor a law giver from between his feet until Shiloh the one who gives rest or the one who makes peace comes and then to him shall be the gathering of the people God is going to send someone special through the tribe of Judah turn if you would now to Isaiah chapter 7 on your way back Isaiah chapter 7 in Isaiah chapter 70 sign is given to a wicked king but that sign is used for tell gods work and in chapter 7 verse 14 Isaiah said therefore the Lord himself is going to give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and shall bear a son and you shall call his name Emanueel what does that mean God with us God will provide himself a lamb keep going in Isaiah if you would Isaiah 35 oh sorry Isaiah 9 I forgot something bad pastor Isaiah chapter 9 also in this subject he said unto us a child is born unto us the son is given verse 6 the government you'll be upon his shoulder second coming his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty God God will provide himself a lamb the everlasting father Jesus said you've seen me you've seen the father were one the prince of peace of the increase of his government there shall be no end upon the throne of David upon his kingdom to order it to establish it with judgment with justice from henceforth even forever the zeal its God's desire of the Lord of hosts will perform this keep going Isaiah 35 can we go back to history that was easier to follow most stop Isaiah 35 Isaiah said strengthen ye verse 3 the weekends confirm the feeble knees say to them that of a fearful heart be strong fear not behold your God will come with vengeance second coming of Christ your God will come with a recompense second coming of Christ he your God will come and save you first coming of Christ and look at how you know it's time then shall the eyes of the blind be open the years of the devil be unstopped then shall the lame man leap as the deer the tongue of the mute shall sing turn to Isaiah 48 on your way back while you're getting there in verse 12 it is God speaking directly through his prophet he said harkin unto me oh Jacob and Israel my called I am he I am the first I am also the last that has got himself the eternal one verse 16 he says still speaking himself come you near unto me and hear ye this I've not spoken in secret from the beginning from the time that it was there am I and now the Lord God literally out on I out on I Yahweh the Father and his Ruah spirit have sent God's the one speaking the Father and his spirit have sent me God unto us a child is given unto us a son is born God will provide himself a limb why is as he send to turn to Isaiah 53 for surely he has born our griefs carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him strict and smitten of God and afflicted we thought he was getting judged for blasphemy but he was wounded for our transgressions verse five Isaiah 53 he was bruised for our iniquities anybody here ever lied you just did if you didn't raise your hand anybody here just obey your parents those two of the 10 commandments he was bruised for that he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him with his stripes were healed verse six all we like sheep have gone astray approved it with two questions we've turned everyone to his own way and the Lord is laid on him God will provide himself a lamb the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth pilot marvel that he wouldn't defend himself he opened not his mouth he's brought us a lamb to the slaughter's a sheep before sheers his mute so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison how many been with us to Israel how many remember the prison under the high priest house the interrogation room under the high priest house that's where they held him that night he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living why for the transgression of my people God will provide himself a lamb was he stricken he made his grave the wicked toothy use with the richness death thank you Joseph and because he had done no violence neither is any deceitness mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he has put him to grief when he shall make his soul an offering for sin God will provide himself a lamb yet he shall see his seed his followers I believe in Jesus I follow him anybody else who enjoying me that's us he'll see his followers means he has to rise again he shall prolong his days pleasure little urchelle prosper in his hand wow well this is awesome so how do we know it's him Zachariah chapter nine Zachariah chapter nine second to last book and he'll test me hit malachi go left Zachariah chapter nine verse nine rejoice greatly a daughter of Zion shout out daughter of Jerusalem behold your king comes unto you he is just and having salvation your God will come and save you and he'll open the eyes of the blind the ears of the death the lame will walk how did Jesus come into Jerusalem on a donkey where did he go next in the temple what did he do those very miracles having salvation lowly riding upon a donkey in the cult the full of a donkey so now finally back to Timothy because I've got to get somewhere in the book Paul an apostle we've covered that by the commandment that is the epitimes the imposed commandment of Christ of God our Savior God in human flesh he added the attribute of humanity so he could live a sinless life so he could substitute his life for years he bore your sin and he bore the wrath you deserve God so love the world he himself came down and took your sin upon himself so he could dismiss your case if you put yourself under the blood of Christ when he you want to tell me God doesn't love you with that background Paul an apostle of Christ Jesus or Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Savior and our Lord Jesus Christ which is our hope he's our hope it's his work that gives us a right to heaven undetimacy perhaps you've heard of them came from Leicester my own son in the faith they're not biologically related but I hope you've had this experience especially in this last month watching you know I'm in the hospital our hot water heater to side up and die some brothers came into care of it we see my brother's come in to care of it snow like out the wazoo a brother came into care of it did the whole street plus our driveway I've been so blessed at these last 30 years with friends and and basically what is essentially church family that I'll say it had been closer to me in my life than my own family Timothy was like a son travel the Paul Saul a Paul endured watch him get persecuted how to hunger to serve the lord like Paul did to Timothy my own son in the faith grace mercy and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ or the Lord Jesus Christ our Lord now I know what you're gonna say you only say every time we do it because you say you want to have peace with God to have the grace of God I've been here I'm not you can't watch him do it watch him just like little monkey with the organ grinder watch him do it well this one's different you miss something grace mercy and peace by the way that pattern holds true for Timothy tightis and second Timothy why the difference because they're overseeing their church we all need God's grace if you don't experience God's grace you never get to his peace until you ask for God's forgiveness through the shed blood of his son well not let's define terms you're speeding down the road you've heard me say you get pulled over the officer comes up what where's the fire buddy you're like I'm sorry man I was like you know it okay tell you what let's give you a warning no ticket go on your way what have you received mercy not getting with you deserve he's walking away turns back come go hey hey listen I know a second runs back he gets a nice coffee with whatever your favorite honey sugar vanilla whatever whatever and two chocolate covered donuts which are your favorite runs back and he says listen I I need to quit I can't fit my vest anymore I shouldn't eat these here there yours trust me that's a problem you know both from vest you better keep it together and uh ends it like here there yours you know to take him now what have you received grace two chocolate donuts and coffee is grace you accept his two chocolate donuts and his ice coffee you open your heart to Jesus he'll give you peace you can have as much peace as you want but you will not have peace with God until you accept the grace of God but back to Timothy if you're going to oversee God's people you had better know mercy Jesus said it all the time to the Pharisees go and learn what this means when Jesus tell you a religious leader to go learn that's bad in public go and learn what this means I would have mercy and not sacrifice over and over Jesus showing the mercy of God so for those who oversee the church yeah you need God's grace and absolutely need peace but don't you forget the key it's all about God's mercy grace mercy and peace from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ finally we made the verse three and know I'm not going to say I'm out of time I can see you're already worried about that too what a day I'm by the way I'm not on drugs okay just say no more Paul then because you're like man this guy is like spun up oh quote Lumiere life is still unnerving to a servant who's not serving be our guest as I besought you Timothy to abide still at Ephesus wow Ephesus what I went in a Macedonia that you might charge some that they teach no other doctrine I left you with Ephesus to keep them doctually straight on hmm believe it or not this is now the third time we have to go the book of Acts and I'll sum up Acts 18 quick journey to Ephesus as high leaves come back to act 19 he goes back through Ephesus meets a bunch of people they've never received the Holy Spirit begins to preach the gospel to them they receive the Spirit and God's starts just blowing the doors off the church at Ephesus it says in Acts 19 God did unusual miracles by the hand of Paul not to like oh I usual miracles no he did unusual miracles not just the usual miracles the unusual miracles those are questions I have for heaven so effective is the preaching of the gospel he's there three years that the seventh wonder one of the seven wonders the ancient world the temple of Diana it has been so effective in preaching the gospel people stop the worshiping Diana turn away from buying the little idols silver smis could upset there's a whole brew ha ha that breaks out of it but he is so effective it is impacting the local deity wow well eventually you had to leave so he leaves and back to as he's working his way to go give the alms in Jerusalem where he gets arrested and all that that's Acts 21 between 19 and 21 comes chapter 20 you guys are good and as he's going by Ephesus he's like yeah I can't stop because I'll never get out of there so he goes to the next town over my latest calls for the elders of Ephesus who come to visit the reason why I did that is because if he goes to Ephesus this is what happens no way any come to our house for dinner how can he went to the house for dinner you never never know there's no way he could see everybody from three years he's smart enough to know go to the next town they show up and he says you know that I have not shunned to declare to you the whole council of God I am innocent of any man's blood you as overseers of the church at Ephesus take heed to the minister you've received from God to shepherd the church that he purchased it's in the chapter with his own blood God will provide himself a lamb it's all through the whole book and then he said I've warned you for three years with crying with tears night and day that after I depart your grievous wolves are going to try to enter the flock and even from among yourselves there are going to be others who rise up and they're going to bring in basically heresies take heed and he leaves and you know the rest of the book because we covered that in the beginning so he says I begged you I besought you Timothy to stay at Ephesus a church that he is very much concerned about and I want you to stay there and here's what I want you to do while you're there I want you to make sure charge some that they teach no other doctrine it was impressed so strongly on Paul's heart that false teaching and doctrine is going to come in and it's going to damage the church so we sent one of the best he could put in that place his own son in the faith Timothy well of course the question comes up so how did it how did it work out you're waiting for me in Revelation 2 Revelation 2 chapter 2 verse 1 Revelation last book your Bible in case you really lost by the way you've been from Genesis the Revelation just so you remember can be done under the angel the messenger the overseer the pastor the church of Ephesus right these things say it here that hold if the seven stars the seven angels messengers or pastors in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden lamp stands or candlesticks the church I know your works he knows yours too I know your labor I know your patience I know how you can't not bear them which are evil and that you have tried them which say there are apostles and or not you have been faithful to judge teaching and doctrine you've been careful to make sure deviation doesn't come in so I'd say that part went well but let's keep reading you've tried them which say there are apostles and are not and you have found them liars and you have born and have patience for my name's sake and you've labored the ideas to the point of exhaustion and you have not fainted nevertheless I have against you because you have not lost you have left your first love I get troubled when I see people start to really amp up on doctrine now please don't misunderstand me he is God in human flesh he is fully man you're fully God not top half man bottom half God not right half man left half God it's called the hypostatic union you use big words see by the books fully God fully man you can die as a man but you cannot kill God he can rise again system act theology books like Hodg and others are this thick those books come from this book with a few other ideas if you will take the time to reach chapter by chapter verse by verse get to the end start over I run two book marks when the old testament won the new when you've had enough old go new we've been through the new while go back to the old so that's just you can mix it up but if you would just keep reading through your bible and read it carefully you have more than this you will have a right understanding of God's truth and doctrine from the original you know they say if you eat a good diet you don't need vitamins because you get the nutrients you need from your good diet you go through the word of God and you study for yourself you dig in you're going to be rooting ground in the faith and when you hear something off like it does not say that God does not help those who help themselves that's Benjamin Franklin poor Richards Omanek doctrine is important but get it from the source why because when I see people get all about doctrine I watch their love for God begin to atrophy it becomes head knowledge and they begin to lose the heart I've seen it over and over again yet if you would stay in your bible you're going to find God is going to disciple your head and he's going to fill your heart it's the best antidote to doctrinal dryness you could ever get stay in love with God what does he say to that church nevertheless I have against you you've left your first love look at the charge remember therefore from where you are fallen when you used to be happy just to read the bible instead of Hodg or Calvin or whoever remember from where you are fallen repent because you've strayed and do the first works when you were just excited to get into the word and like man I actually understood it when you were happy like Mary just to sit at his feet and to hear him we're headed into a time of weirdness case you didn't notice and the best way not to be deceived and get sucked into the wordness is to be rooted and grounded not an a H Hodg or others spurgen or others all good men but in the word there's a live quicker sharp than any two-digit sword all things are naked and open for the eyes of him with whom we have to do and to be in love with the one who came down and took your place and shed his blood so he could dismiss your case that's where real walk with God happens God doesn't want you religious he wants a relationship be careful you don't lose it but now we are out of time I guess we got three verses in not bad for me father thank you for your word thank you for this day Lord if there's anyone here they have yet to make the Lord Jesus their savior all you got to do is open your heart he's been knocking you're you're here in the room or listening or lie streaming or getting on the radio or wherever it showed up in your feed that's here because God wants you to know he came down and took your place he's not against you he died for you so Lord how I pray that heart that finally realizes they need you right where they are they would ask you to come in they would ask you to forgive them you would change them thank you for your word Lord in Jesus name amen
