# This Week’s Signals: Scripture reference + John
*Generated: 2026-02-20 12:41 UTC*

The loudest convergence across the network was **Scripture reference**. Close behind: **Story**. Scripture gravity centered most on **John** (341 references across 61 sermons).

What matters isn’t the metric—it’s what the metrics reveal about formation. Drift stayed relatively steady versus the prior period—no major macro whiplash. Use this as a listening aid: to clarify your next emphasis, and to spot drift early before it becomes culture.

### Theme convergence
- **Scripture reference** — 120 sermons — avg density 7.32 — total 878
- **Story** — 120 sermons — avg density 4.98 — total 597.4
- **Experience** — 120 sermons — avg density 2.94 — total 352.5

### Scripture focus
- **John** — 341 references across 61 sermons (avg 5.6/sermon)
- **Isaiah** — 211 references across 39 sermons (avg 5.4/sermon)

- **Revelation** — 136 references across 43 sermons (avg 3.2/sermon)

**3.** Signal: **Scripture reference** kept showing up across the network. Meaning: that’s where people are being formed—either toward clarity or toward cliché. Action: tighten the center.

**4.** Signal: **John** carried the most weight this period. Meaning: our shared imagination is being shaped there. Action: preach it in a way that reveals Christ, not just supports a point.
